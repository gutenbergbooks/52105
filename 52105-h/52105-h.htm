<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>This compilation was begun in the preparedness atmosphere
of the U. S. Army Neuropsychiatric Training School
at Boston, 1917-18. This particular school had to adapt
itself to the clinical material of the Psychopathic Hospital.
Although war cases early began to drift into the wards
(even including some overseas material), it was thought
well to supplement the ordinary “acute, curable, and incipient”
mental cases of the hospital wards and out-patient
service with representative cases from the literature.</p>

<p>As time wore on, this “preparedness” ideal gave place
to the ideal of a collection of cases to serve as a source-book
for reconstructionists dealing with neuroses and psychoses.
Shortage of medical staff and delays incidental to the influenza
epidemic held the book back still further, and, as meantime
Brown and Williams had served the immediate need
with their <i>Neuropsychiatry and the War</i>, it was determined
to make the compilation the beginning of a case-history
book on the neuropsychiatry of the war, following in part
the traditions of various case-books in law and medicine.</p>

<p>With the conclusion of the armistice, there is by no means
an end of these problems. Peace-practice in neuropsychiatry
is bound to undergo great changes and improvements,
if only from the influx into the peace-community of many
more trained neuropsychiatrists than were ever before available.
This is particularly true in the American community
by reason of the many good men specially trained in camp
and hospital neuropsychiatry, both at home and in the
A. E. F., through the enlightened policy of our army in
establishing special divisions of the Surgeon-General’s Office
dealing separately with those problems.</p>

<p>Though a book primarily for physicians, some of its material
has interest for <i>line-officers</i>, who may see how much
“criming” is matter for medical experts, by running through
the boxed headings (especially of Sections <a href="#A_PSYCHOSES_INCIDENTAL_IN_THE_WAR">A</a> and <a href="#B_SHELL-SHOCK_NATURE_AND_CAUSES">B</a>) and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[ii]</a></span>
reading the simulation cases. As Chavigny remarks, “shooting
madmen neither restrains crime nor sets a good example.”</p>

<p>But parts of the book look ahead to <i>Reconstruction</i>.
Surely occupation-workers, vocationalists, war risk insurance
experts, and in fact all reconstructionists, medical and lay, must
find much to their advantage in the data of <a href="#D_TREATMENT_AND_RESULTS_OF">Section D (Treatment
and Results)</a>. Had time permitted, the whole old
story of “Railway Spine”&mdash;Shell-shock’s congener&mdash;might
have been covered in a series of cases from last century’s
literature, together with others illustrating the effects of
suggestion and psychotherapy; but this must be a post-bellum
task.</p>

<p>The compiler, who has personally dictated (and as a rule
redictated and twice condensed) all the cases from the originals
(or in a few instances, <i>e.g.</i>, Russian, from translations), hopes
he has not added anything new to the accounts. The cases
are drawn from the literature of the belligerents, 1914-1917,
English, French, Italian, Russian, and&mdash;so far as available
here&mdash;German and Austrian.</p>

<p>I would call the collection not so much a posey of other
men’s flowers as a handful of their <i>seeds</i>. For I have constantly
not so much transcribed men’s general conclusions as
borrowed their specific fine-print and footnotes. The lure
of the 100 per cent has been very strong in many authors; but
the test of fine-print, viz., of the actual case-protocols, saves
us from premature conclusions, and the plan of the book
allows us to confront actualities with actualities. One gets
the impression of a dignified debate from the way in which
case-histories automatically confront each other, say in
<a href="#C_THE_DIAGNOSIS_OF_SHELL-SHOCK">Section C (Diagnosis)</a>.</p>

<p>Obligations to the books of Babinski and Froment, Eder,
Hurst, Mott (Lettsomian Lectures), Roussy and Lhermitte,
Elliot Smith and Pear, and others are obvious. Yealland’s
book came too late for sampling its miracles, though cases of
his in the periodical literature had already been incorporated
in my selection.</p>

<p>Some of the cases in <a href="#I_SYPHILOPSYCHOSES">Section A, <span class="smcapuc">I</span></a>, had already been abstracted
in Neurosyphilis: Modern Systematic Diagnosis and
Treatment (Southard and Solomon, 1917).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[iii]</a></span></p>

<p>What we actually have made is a case-history book in the
newly combined fields now collectively termed <i>neuropsychiatry</i>.
The more <i>general</i> the good general practitioner of
medicine, the more of a <i>neuropsychiatrist</i>! And this is no
pious wish or counsel of perfection. Neuropsychiatry, mental
hygiene, psychotherapy and somatotherapy&mdash;all these will
flourish intra-bellum and post-bellum, in days of destruction
and in days of reconstruction. And who amongst us, medical
or lay, will not have to deal in reconstruction days with cases
like some here compiled? A minor blessing of the war will be
the incorporation of mental hygiene in general medical practice
and in auxiliary fields of applied sociology, <i>e.g.</i>, medico-social
work.</p>

<p>Subsidies aiding publication are due to the National
Committee for Mental Hygiene; the Permanent Charity
Foundation (Boston Safe Deposit and Trust Company);
Mrs. Zoe D. Underhill of New York; Mr. H. T. White of
New York; and Dr. W. N. Bullard of Boston&mdash;to all of
these the various military recipients of the book will be under
obligations, as well as others who would otherwise have had
to pay the great <i>majoration de prix</i> due to war times.</p>

<p>Of those great dead contributors to neurology laid (in the
<a href="#E_EPICRISIS">Epicrisis</a>) at the feet of the neo-Attila, perhaps only Sir
Victor was in a narrow sense the Kaiser’s victim: still, but
for the war, they might all remain to us.</p>

<p>By the way, just as I found John Milton had said things
that fitted neurosyphilis, so also Dante is observed in the
chosen mottoes to have had inklings even of Shell-shock.
To the <i>Inferno</i> it was natural to turn for fitting mottoes
(Carlyle’s renderings mainly used). The pages might have
been strewn with them. A glint of too great optimism might
seem to shine&mdash;in the pre-Epicrisis motto&mdash;from the lance of
Achilles with its “sad yet healing gift;” but out of Shell-shock
Man may get to know his own mind a little better, how under
stress and strain the mind lags, blocks, twists, shrinks, and
even splits, but on the whole is afterwards made good again.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>The duties of an introducer, whether of a platform speaker
to an audience, or of a writer to his anticipated readers, are not
always clearly defined. It has been sometimes said that the
critic or reviewer may meet with better success if he has not
acquainted himself too thoroughly with the contents of the
book about which he writes, as in that case he will have a larger
opportunity to indulge his imagination, but a critique thus produced
may have the disadvantage of possible shortcoming or
unfairness. In the case of this volume, however, I have felt it
worth while to acquaint myself with its contents, no light task
when one is confronted with a thousand pages.</p>

<p>The great war just closing has done much to enlighten us as
to the causes, nature, outcome, and treatment of injuries and
diseases to which its victims have been subjected. The object
of this book is to present both the data and the principles involved
in certain neuropsychiatry problems of the war. These
are presented in a wealth of detail through an extraordinary
series of case records (589 in all) drawn from current medical
literature, during the first three years of the conflict. Case
reporting is here seen at its best, and the experiences recorded
are largely allowed to speak for themselves, although
comments are not wanting and are often illuminating.</p>

<p>Many criticisms have been heard on the use of the term <i>Shell-shock</i>
as applied to some of the most important psychiatric and
neurological problems of the recent war; but that the designation
has meaning will be evident if Dr. Southard’s book is not
simply skimmed over by the reader, but is studied in its entirety.
The symptoms of a very large number, if not the majority, of
the cases recorded, had for their initiating influence the psychic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
and physical horrors of life among exploding shells. As the
author and those from whom he has received his clinical supply
not infrequently point out, in many cases it would appear that
purely psychic influences have played the chief rôle, but in others
physical injuries have not been lacking. Much more than this
is true: in many instances the soil was prepared by previous
defect, disease, or injury, or to use one of Dr. Southard’s favorite
expressions, “weak spots” were present before martial causes
became operative.</p>

<p>While the contributions to the medical and surgical history of
the war have been somewhat numerous in current medical journals
and in monographs, few comprehensive volumes have appeared.
The reasons for this are not far to seek. The conflict
has been of such magnitude, and the demands on the bodily and
mental activity of the medical profession have been so intense
and continuous, that time and opportunity for the careful and
complete recording of experiences have not been often available;
but works are beginning to appear in the languages of all the
belligerent countries and these will increase in number and
value during the next lustrum and decade, although it may be
that some of the most important contributions will come after a
decade or more is past. The great work before me is one that
will leave its lasting impress, not only upon military but on civil
medicine, for the lessons to be drawn from its pages are in large
part as applicable to the one as to the other.</p>

<p>Looking backward to our Civil War, one is strongly impressed
with the fact that the present volume, one of the earliest works
of its kind to appear in book form, deals largely with psychiatry
and functional nervous diseases, whereas during and after the
American conflict the most important contributions to neurology
related to organic disease, especially as illustrated by the work
of Weir Mitchell and his collaborators on injuries of nerves.
This is the more interesting when it is remembered that Mitchell
not very long after the close of the Civil War became the most
prominent exponent of functional neurology, from the diagnostic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
and therapeutic sides. To him the profession the world over has
been indebted for the development of new views as to the nature
of neurasthenia and hysteria and new methods for combating
these disorders. In this fact is to be found matter for thought.
Those who handled best the neuropsychiatric problems of the
present war were in large part qualified not merely by a knowledge
of psychology and psychiatry, but far more by a thorough
training in organic neurology. The problems of psychiatry can
be grasped fully only by those who have a fundamental knowledge
of the anatomy, physiology, and diseases of the nervous
system.</p>

<p>Dr. Southard, preëminently a neuropathologist, is well
grounded in organic neurology, and shows at every turn his
capabilities for considering the neuroses, psychoses, and insanities
from the standpoint of the neurologist. Moreover, he
clearly shows training and insight into the problems of non-neurological
internal medicine.</p>

<p>The ideal method of training a student for neuropsychiatric
work&mdash;if one had the opportunity of directing his course
from the time of his entry into medicine&mdash;would be to see to
it, after a good grounding in the fundamental sciences like
anatomy, physiology, and chemistry, that medicine and surgery
in their broadest phases first received school and hospital attention;
that the fields of neurology, pure and applied, were then
fully explored; and that psychology and psychiatry received late
but thorough consideration. When after America’s entrance into
the world war the writer assisted in preparing medical reserve
officers for neuropsychiatric service, those men did best both
during their postgraduate work and in base hospitals and in
the field, who had built from the bottom after the manner indicated.</p>

<p>At the outset of Dr. Southard’s book, for more than two hundred
and fifty pages, the author considers under ten subdivisions
the acquired diseases and constitutional defects which may predispose
the soldier to functional and reflex nervous disease.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
Neurosyphilis, on which Dr. Southard and Dr. Solomon have
already given us a valuable treatise, the pharmacopsychoses,
especially alcoholism, and the somatopsychoses covering fevers
like typhoid and paratyphoid, are considered in numerous carefully
chosen case reports. The reader needs only to look closely
into the case records of the first quarter of the volume to get a
knowledge of the affections chiefly predisposing the soldier or
civilian to functional and reflex nervous diseases. To those
familiar with the medical history of the war it is well known
that one of the reasons for the efficiency of the American Expeditionary
Force resided in the fact that the preliminary
examinations of the recruits received the fullest attention not
only from the points of view of acquired and inherited disease,
but also from those of special psychiatric and even psychological
deficiencies. Our country, however, had for its guidance the
experience of nations which were fighting for three years before
we entered the arena and in addition had a large surplus of
material from which to cull out the weaklings.</p>

<p>Among the predispositional affections considered&mdash;besides
syphilis, alcohol, and other drug habits, and the somatopsychoses&mdash;are
the feeble-mindednesses or hypophrenoses, the epilepsies,
the psychoses due to focal brain lesions, the presenile and senile
disorders, the schizophrenoses including dementia præcox and
allied affections, the cyclothymoses like manic depressive insanity,
the psychoneuroses, and the psychopathoses. The last two
subjects indicated, considered in <a href="#X_PSYCHONEUROSES">special</a> <a href="#XI_PSYCHOPATHOSES">chapters</a>, seem to some
extent to be receptacles for affections which cannot well be
otherwise placed,&mdash;hallucinoses, hysteria, neurasthenia, and psychasthenia,&mdash;and
under the psychopathoses, pathological lying,
Bolshevism, delinquencies of various sorts, homosexuality, suicide
and self-mutilation, nosophobia, and even claustrophobia with
its exemplar who preferred exposure to shell-fire to remaining in
a tunnel.</p>

<p>Under the encephalopsychoses are found interesting illustrations
of focal lesions and the general effects of infection and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
toxemia. Cases of brain abscess, of spinal focal lesions, and
meningeal hemorrhage are in evidence, aphasias, monoplegias,
Jacksonian spasm, and thalamic disease receiving consideration.</p>

<p>All neurologists know the difficulties in diagnosticating epilepsy
in the absence of opportunities to see attacks and to receive the
carefully analyzed statement of the observers of the patient.
All this and much more is well brought out in <a href="#III_EPILEPTOSES">the chapter on the
epileptoses</a>. Many epileptics found their way into the armies
either through the carelessness of examiners or by suppression of
the facts on the part of those who desired to serve.</p>

<p>The fact that an imbecile can shoot straight and face fire
comes out in one or two places, but this does not seem to prove
that a good rifleman is necessarily an all-round good soldier.</p>

<p>A book like Dr. Southard’s could be made of much use in
teaching students, especially postgraduates, by having them,
when a particular subject like epilepsy or schizophrenia, for instance,
is under discussion, use as collateral reading the case
reports of this work.</p>

<p>Dr. Southard’s book will prove useful to many workers&mdash;to
the medical officer whose duty it is to examine recruits for the
service or to pass upon and treat them while in service; almost
equally to the medical officer in time of peace; to authors of textbooks
and treatises and to contributors to neurological and psychiatric
journals; to lecturers and clinical demonstrators; to
the examiner for the juvenile courts; and to members of the
psychopathic, psychiatric, and neurological staffs of our
hospitals.</p>

<p>One is not called upon in an introduction to review at length
the contents of the volume, but it may prove of value to the
reader to dip here and there into the pages of the work to which
his attention is being invited.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that fifty years ago and much later,
down to the time of Babinski’s active propaganda in favor of
the theories of suggestion, counter-suggestion, and persuasion in
hysteria, various affections of a vasomotor and thermic type<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
were included in the list of hysterical phenomena. These and
some other phenomena sometimes classed as hysterical, Babinski
and those who accord with him now find it necessary to sweep
entirely from the domain of hysteria, which being produced by
suggestion and cured by counter-suggestion or persuasion cannot
include symptoms which are beyond the control of the will and
intellect of the patient.</p>

<p>According to the new or rather revived pronouncement, these
must be due either to definite organic lesion, or to a disorder of
reflex origin, connoting the occurrence of changes in the nervous
centers as long ago taught by Vulpian and Charcot. In the
records of cases and in the discussions thereon this differentiation
receives much consideration.</p>

<p>It is held that the paralysis in the reflex cases is more limited,
more persistent, and assumes special forms not observable in
hysteria. The attitudes in hysterical palsies conform more to
the natural positions of the limbs than do those observed in
reflex paralysis. Probably the presence of marked amyotrophies
in the reflex nervous disorders is the most convincing factor in
separating these from pithiatic affections. These atrophies correspond
to the arthritic muscular atrophies of Vulpian, Charcot,
Gowers, and others, and cannot for a moment be regarded as
caused by suggestion or as removable by counter-suggestion or
persuasion. They are influenced, discounting the effect of time
and natural recuperation, only by methods of treatment designed
to improve the peripheral and central nutrition of the
patient. Pithiatic atrophies are slight and probably always to
be accounted for by disuse or the association of some peripheral
neural disorder with the hysteria. Affections of the sudatory
and pilatory systems are more definitely pronounced in reflex
cases than in those of a strictly hysterical character.</p>

<p>Some of the facts brought forward by Babinski and Froment
to demonstrate the differentiation of reflex paralyses from pithiatic
disorders of motion are challenged in the records of this
volume by others, as for instance, by Dejerine, Roussy, Marie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
and Guillain. Babinski tells us that in pithiatism, properly so
designated, the tendon reflexes are not affected. He believes
that even in pronounced anesthesia of the lower extremities the
plantar reflexes can always be elicited and are not abnormal in
exhibition. Dejerine, however, produces cases to illustrate the
fact that in marked hysterical anesthesia of the feet plantar
responses cannot be produced. I have personally studied cases
which lend some strength to either contention. In some of
these I was not able to conclude that either the use of the will
or the presence of contractions in extension was sufficient to
exclude the normal responses.</p>

<p>Differences in muscle tonicity, in mechanical irritability of
the muscles, and the presence or absence of fibrotendinous contractions
are indications of a separation between the reflex and
purely functional cases, as apparently demonstrated in some of
the case records. True trophic disorders of the skin, hair, and
bones observed in the reflex cases are also said to have no place
in the illustrations of pithiatism.</p>

<p>The delver into the case histories of this volume will find numerous
instructive combinations of hystero-reflex and organo-hysterical
associations which are not to be enumerated in an
introduction. The great importance of what all recognize as
pathognomonic signs of organic disease&mdash;Babinski extensor toe
response, persistent foot clonus, reactions of degeneration,
marked atrophy, lost tendon jerks, etc.&mdash;is, of course, continuously
in evidence. Extraordinary associations of hysterical,
organic, and reflex disorders with other affections due to direct
involvement of bone, muscle, and vessels and with the secondary
effects of cicatrization and immobilization are brought out
on many pages. In quitting this branch of our subject it might
be remarked that considerable changes must be made in our
textbook descriptions of nervous diseases in the light of the contributions
to the neurology of the present war.</p>

<p>One is reminded in the details of some of the cases of the discussions
some decades since on the subject of spinal traumatisms;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
of the work of Erichsen which resulted in giving his name and
that of “railway spine” to many of the cases now commonly
spoken of as traumatic hysteria and traumatic neurasthenia; of
the rejoinders of Page and his views regarding spinal traumatisms;
and of Oppenheim’s development of the symptom complex
of what he prefers to term the traumatic neurosis. One
who has taken part in much court work cannot but read these
case records with interest, for the neurology of the war as presented
in this volume and in numerous monographs which are
now appearing, throws much light upon many often mooted
medicolegal problems. I recall how many able and honest neurological
observers have changed their points of view since the
early days of Erichsen’s “railway spine,” a pathological suggestion
which is said to have cost the corporations of England an
almost fabulous sum during a score of years. I recall also that
a certain Court of Appeals in one of our states even felt itself
called upon to promulgate an opinion intended to exorcise entirely
the plea for damages for alleged injuries if it could be
shown that these were due to fright. The data of this book do
not put weapons entirely into the hands of the attorney and
the expert for either the plaintiff or the defendant.</p>

<p>Some of the French writers on the neurology of the war, as
illustrated in the records collected by Dr. Southard, have brought
to our attention distinctions which they draw between <i>états
commotionnels</i> and <i>états émotionnels</i>&mdash;happy terms, and yet not
sufficient in their invention or in the explanations which accompany
them, fully to satisfy the requirements of the facts
presented. These writers seem to think of the commotional
states as denoting some real disease or condition of the brain,
and yet one which is really curable and reversible. They explicitly
tell us, however, that these commotions fall short of
being <i>lésionnel</i>. After all, is this not somewhat obscure? Is it
not something of a return to the period of “railway spine”
when one of the comparisons sometimes made was that the
injury suffered by the nervous tissues produced in them a state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
comparable to that of a magnet which had been subjected to a
severe blow? At any rate, in commotion thus discussed the
nervous structures are supposed to sustain some real injury of a
physiochemical character, whereas in the emotional states the
neurones are, as Southard puts it, affected somewhat after the
manner of normal emotional functioning, except perhaps that
they are called upon to deliver an excessive stream of impulses.
The latter would be classed among the psychopathic, the former
among the physiopathic affections, and yet the distinction between
the two is not always quite clear.</p>

<p>In not a few instances of Shell-shock&mdash;although these are
not numerous, so far as records have been obtained&mdash;actual
structural lesions have been recorded even in cases in which no
direct external injury of a material kind was experienced as a
result of the explosion of shells. In others the evidences of
external injury were relatively unimportant. Various lesions, in
some cases recognizable even by the naked eye, were present.
Mott, for example, found not only minute hemorrhages, but in
one instance a bulbar extravasation of moderate massiveness,
the patient not showing external signs of injury. Cases are also
recorded of hematomyelia; others with edematous or necrotic
areas in the cord; and still others with lesions of the ependyma
or even with splitting of the spinal canal, reminding one of the
classical experiments of Duret on cerebral and cerebrospinal
traumatisms.</p>

<p>It has been argued that too much stress should not be laid
on a few cases of this sort&mdash;but are they as few as they seem
to be? The fact is that necropsical opportunities are not often
afforded. May not such scattered lesions often be present without
resulting in death or even in long continued disturbance?
There is no essential reason why minute hemorrhages into the
brain and spinal cord, and especially into their membranes, may
not undergo rapid absorption or even remain unchanged for
some time without dire results.</p>

<p>One of the reported cases in which lung splitting occurred from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
severe concussion without external injury is not without interest
in this connection, reminding one, as the commentator says, of
those cases of severe concussion in which the interior of a building
is injured while the exterior escapes. In the same connection
also the cited experiments of Mairet and Durante on rabbits
are not without instructiveness. As a result of explosives set off
close to these animals, pulmonary apoplexy, spinal cord and root
hemorrhages, and extravasations, perivascular and ependymal,
and into the cortical and bulbar gray were found. Russca obtained
direct and <i>contrecoup</i> brain lesions, etc., in a similar way.</p>

<p>Here and there throughout the book will be found references
to symptoms and syndromes which will have a particular interest
for the reader&mdash;soldier’s heart, trench foot, congealed hand,
tics, tremors, convulsions, sensory areas variously mapped, and
forms of local tetanus, the last being distinctly to be differentiated
from pithiatic contractures and those due to organic
lesions of the nervous system. Cases of an affection described
by Souques as camptocormia, from Greek words meaning to
bend the trunk, were shown to the Neurological Society of Paris
in 1914 and later, the main features of this affection being pronounced
incurvation forward of the trunk from the dorsolumbar
region, with extreme abduction and outward rotation of the
lower limbs, pain in the back, and difficult and tremulous walking.
In some of these cases, organic lesions of the trunkal tissues
were present, but in addition psychic elements played a not unimportant
part, and the cases were restored to health by a combination
of physical measures with psychotherapy, enforced by
electrical applications.</p>

<p>The part of this book given over to <a href="#D_TREATMENT_AND_RESULTS_OF">the discussion of treatment</a>
will doubtless to some prove the most interesting section.
The presentation of the subject of therapeutics is in some degree
a discussion also of diagnosis and prognosis; and so it happens in
various parts of the volume that the particular subject under
consideration is more or less a reaffirmation or anticipation of
remarks under other headings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span></p>

<p>Similar results are brought about by various therapeutic procedures.
Nonne, Myers, and a few others bring hypnosis into
the foreground, although non-hypnotic suggestion plays a larger
rôle by far.</p>

<p>Miracle cures are wrought through many pages. Mutism,
deafness and blindness, palsies, contractures, and tics disappear
at times as if by magic under various forms of suggestion. Ether
or chloroform narcosis drives out the malady at the moment
when it reveals its true nature. Verbal suggestion has many
adjuvants and collaborators&mdash;electricity, sometimes severely
administered, lumbar puncture, injections of stovaine into the
cerebrospinal fluid, injections of saline solution, colored lights,
vibrations, active mechanotherapy, hydrotherapy, hot air baths
and blasts, massage, etc. Painful and punitive measures have
their place&mdash;one is inclined to think a less valuable place than
is given them by some of the recorders. In some instances the
element of suggestion, while doubtless present, is overshadowed
by the material methods employed. Persuasion and actual
physical improvement are in these cases highly important. Reëducation
is not infrequently in evidence. The patient in one
way or another is taught how to do things which he had lost
the way of doing.</p>

<p>It is interesting to American neurologists to note how frequently
in the reports, especially of French observers, the “Weir
Mitchell treatment” was the method employed, including isolation,
the faradic current, massage, and Swedish movements, hydrotherapy,
dietetic measures, reëducative processes, and powerful
suggestion variously exhibited, especially through the mastery
of the physician over the patient. It is rather striking that few
records of Freudian psychoanalytic therapy are presented.</p>

<p>When all is said, however, counter-suggestion and persuasion,
in whatever guise made use of, were not always sufficient and
this not only in the clearly organic cases, but in those which are
ranked under the head of reflex nervous disorders. In these the
long-continued use of physical agencies was found necessary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
supplement the purely psychic procedures, these facts sometimes
giving rise in the Paris Society of Neurology and elsewhere
to animated discussion as to the real nature of the cases. The
pithiatic features of the case at times disappear, but leave behind
much to be explained and more to be accomplished. The
cures wrought are not always permanent and in some cases post-bellum
experiences may be required to prove the real value of
the measures advocated. The reader must study well the detailed
records in order to arrive at just conclusions; nevertheless,
the tremendous efficacy of suggestion and persuasion stands
out in many of the recitals.</p>

<p>Perhaps the author may permit the introducer a little liberty
of comment. His non-English interpellations, especially Latin
and French, may be regarded by some as overdone or perhaps
pedantic, but are rather piquant, giving zest to the text. <i>Diagnosis
per exclusionem in ordine</i> is sonorous and has a scholarly
flavor, but does not prevent the reader who lives beyond the
faubourgs of Boston from understanding that the author is speaking
of an ancient and well-tried method of differential diagnosis.
<i>Passim</i> may be more impressive or thought-fixing than its English
translation, but this to the reader will simply prove a matter of
individual opinion. <i>Psychopathia martialis</i> is not only mouth-filling
like <i>Senegambia</i> or <i>Mesopotamia</i>, but really has a claim to
appreciation through its evident applicability. It is agreeable
to note that the book seems nowhere to indicate that <i>psychopathia
sexualis</i> and <i>psychopathia martialis</i> are convertible terms.</p>

<p>The <a href="#BIBLIOGRAPHY">bibliography</a> of the volume challenges admiration because
of its magnitude and thoroughness and is largely to be credited,
as the author indicates, to the energy and efficiency of Sergeant
Norman Fenton, who did the work in connection with the Neuropsychiatric
Training School at Boston, resorting first-hand to
the Boston Medical Library and the Library of the New York
Academy of Medicine. After Sergeant Fenton joined the American
Expeditionary Force, Dr. Southard greatly increased the
value of the bibliography by his personal efforts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span></p>

<p>This bibliography covers not only the 589 case histories of the
book, but it goes beyond this, especially in the presentation of
references for 1917, 1918, and even 1919. Owing to the time
when our country entered the war, American references are, in
the main, of later date than the case histories. They will be
found none the less of value to the student of neuropsychiatric
problems.</p>

<p>The references in the bibliography number in all more than
two thousand, distributed so far as nationalities are concerned
about as given below, although some mistakes may have crept
into this enumeration for various reasons, like the publication of
the same articles in the journals of different countries. The list
of references includes French, 895; British (English and Colonial),
396; Italian, 77; Russian, 100; American, 253; Spanish,
5; Dutch, 5; Scandinavian, 5; and Austrian and German, 476.
It will be seen, therefore, that the bibliography covers in number
nearly four times the collected case studies, most of these records
being from reports made during the first three years of the war.
The author has wisely made an effort to bring the bibliographic
work up to and partially including 1919.</p>

<p>The manner in which the French neurologists and alienists
continued their work during the strenuous days of the terrible
conflict is worthy of all praise. The labors of the Society of
Neurology of Paris never flagged, its contributions in current
medical journals having become familiar to neurologists who
have followed closely the trend of medical events during the
war. Cases and subjects were also frequently presented and
discussed at the neurological centers connected with the French
and allied armies in France.</p>

<p>It may be almost invidious to specify names, the work done
by many was of so much interest and value. Dejerine in the
early days of the war, before his untimely sickness and death,
contributed his part. Marie from the beginning to the end of
the conflict continued to make the neurological world his debtor.
The name of Babinski stands out in striking relief. Other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
names frequently appearing among the French contributors are
those of Froment, Clovis Vincent, Roussy and Lhermitte, Léri,
Guillain, Souques, Laignel-Lavastine, Courbon, Grasset, Claude,
Barre, Benisty, Foix, Chavigny, Charpentier, Meige, Thomas,
and Sollier.</p>

<p>For a work of this character not only as complete a bibliography
as possible, but a thorough <a href="#INDEX">index</a> is absolutely necessary,
and this has been supplied. The author has not made the index
too full, but with enough cross-references to enable those in all
lines of medical work interested to cull out the cases and comments
which most concern them.</p>

<p>My prologue finished, I step aside for the play and the player,
with the recommendation to the reader that he give close heed
to the performance&mdash;to the recital of the cases, the comments
thereon, and the general discussion of subjects&mdash;knowing that
such attention will be fully rewarded, for in this wonderful collection
of Dr. Southard is to be seen an epitome of war neurology
not elsewhere to be found.</p>

<p>The data from all the belligerent countries, collected in
this book, go far to prove that, whatever at last you elect
to term Shell-shock, you must pause to consider whether your
putative case is not actually:</p>

<p>A matter of spirochetes?</p>

<p>The response of a subnormal soldier?</p>

<p>An equivalent of epilepsy?</p>

<p>An alcoholic situation?</p>

<p>A result of neurones actually <i>hors de combat</i>?</p>

<p>A state of bodily weakness (perhaps of <i>faiblesse irritable</i>)?</p>

<p>A bit of dementia praecox?</p>

<p>One of the ups and downs of the emotional (affective,
cyclothymic) psychoses?</p>

<p>An odd psychopathic reaction in which the response is
abnormal not so much by reason of excessive stimulus as
by reason of defective power of response?</p>

<p>On a simpler basis, is not our Shell-shocker just a banal
example of hysteria, neurasthenia, psychasthenia; and is not
this psychoneurotic more peculiar in his capacity to be
shocked than are the conditions that purvey the shocks?</p>

<p>Put more concretely in the terms of available tests and
criteria, open to the psychiatrist, does not every putative
Shell-shock soldier deserve at some stage a blood test for
syphilis? Should we not be reasonably sure we are not facing
a man inadequate to start with, so far as mental tests
avail? Should we not verify (even at considerable expense
of time and money by so-called “social service” methods)
the facts of epilepsy and epileptic taint? Of alcoholism?
And so on? There can be no two answers to these questions.</p>

<p>Upon the following page is a practical grouping of mental
diseases, devised in the first place, not for war psychoses, but
for the initial sifting of psychopathic hospital cases. Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
the psychopathic hospital group of cases constitutes in peace
practice the closest analogue of the mental cases met in active
military practice, because the “incipient, acute, and curable”<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
cases, for which psychopathic hospitals are built and which
flock to or are sent to the wards and outdoor departments of
such hospitals, are precisely the cases that early come forward
in active military practice. They are precisely the cases in
which that pathological event&mdash;whatever it is&mdash;we know
as Shell-shock may be expected to develop. It is precisely
the “incipient, acute, and curable” instances of mental
disease which we hope to exclude from our American army by
cis-Atlantic winnowing-out at the hands of neuropsychiatric
experts&mdash;the best preventive we hope both of Shell-shock
and of other worse mental conditions, if such there be. Military
mental practice plainly deals, not so much with frank and
committable insanity, as with mental diseases of a medically
milder but a militarily far more insidious nature.</p>

<p>A further inspection of this grouping of mental diseases
shows not only that it contains many conditions not usually
termed “insanity” (such as, e.g., feeblemindedness, epilepsy,
alcoholism, sundry somatic diseases, psychoneuroses), but
that these conditions are presented for practical purposes in
a certain seemingly arbitrary order. Without attempting
to justify this selection of scope (not too wide for modern
psychiatry, most would readily acknowledge), I shall draw
out a little further what I consider to be the virtues of the
order selected. In the first place, all will concede, <i>some</i> order
of consideration of collected data is a prime necessity to the
tyro. Without an order of consideration the diagnostic tyro
is but too apt to find in the best textbooks of psychiatry
(even more easily the better the textbook) all he needs to
prove that the case in hand is&mdash;almost anything he selects
to make his case conform to! And how much more dangerous
this debating-society method of diagnosis (by choice of
a side and matching a textbook type) may become in the fluid
and elastic conditions of psychopathic hospital practice, can
readily be observed by one who contemplates the <i>formes
frustes</i> and entity-sketches that the “incipient, acute, and
curable” group of cases presents.</p>

PRACTICAL GROUPING OF MENTAL DISEASES</h4>

<p>The order adopted for these groups (which roughly correspond to botanical

basis of available tests, criteria, or information: the actual diagnosis is a
product of still further differentiation within the several groups.</p>

<p>No conclusions are intended to be drawn in these introductory
pages. Such conclusions as are risked are placed in the
<a href="#E_EPICRISIS">Epicrisis (see Section E)</a>. But so much can be said: If
we are ever to surround the problem of Shell-shock (<i>intra
bellum</i> or <i>post bellum</i>), we must approach it with no artificial
and <i>à priori</i> limitations of its scope. We must not even
agree beforehand that Shell-shock is nothing but psychoneurosis:
that would be a deductive decision unworthy of
modern science. In the collection of these cases, I have tried
to place the topic upon the broadest clinical base. Samples
of virtually every sort of mental disease and of several sorts
of nervous disease have been laid down, some obviously not
instances of Shell-shock, some mixed with clinical phenomena
of Shell-shock, others hard to tell offhand from Shell-shock&mdash;the
whole on the basis that we shall earliest learn what
Shell-shock, the pathological event, is by studying what it
is not. As the sequel may show, we are perhaps not
entitled to regard Shell-shock, the pathological event, as
always associated with shell-shock, the physical event. We
shall, therefore, find in <a href="#A_PSYCHOSES_INCIDENTAL_IN_THE_WAR">Section A</a> (see tables on pages <a href="#Page_6">6</a>
and <a href="#Page_7">7</a>).</p>

<p>(1) Cases without either physical shell-shock, or pathological
Shell-shock&mdash;psychoses of various kinds incidental
in the war (--+).</p>

<p>(2) Cases with physical shell-shock but without pathological
Shell-shock&mdash;psychoses of various kinds seemingly
liberated by, aggravated by, or accelerated by the physical
factor of shell-shock (+-+).</p>

<p>(3) Cases without physical shell-shock but with both
symptoms of pathological Shell-shock as well as of other
psychosis (-++).</p>

<p>(4) Cases with physical shell-shock, with clinical phenomena
of Shell-shock, as well as of other psychosis (+++).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>At the end of <a href="#A_PSYCHOSES_INCIDENTAL_IN_THE_WAR">Section A</a>, accordingly, we shall be left with
two more formulae for discussion in Sections <a href="#B_SHELL-SHOCK_NATURE_AND_CAUSES">B</a>, <a href="#C_THE_DIAGNOSIS_OF_SHELL-SHOCK">C</a>, and <a href="#D_TREATMENT_AND_RESULTS_OF">D</a>, viz:</p>

<p>(5) Cases without physical shell-shock but with symptoms
of pathological Shell-shock (-+-).</p>

<p>(6) Cases with physical shell-shock and pathological Shell-shock
(++-).</p>

<p>The data of <a href="#A_PSYCHOSES_INCIDENTAL_IN_THE_WAR">Section A</a> will solidly prove that Shell-shock,
however picturesque the term for laymen or in the <i>argot</i> of
the clinic, is medically most intriguing. As we cannot get
rid of the term (even by suppressing it in parentheses or by
condemning it to the limbo of the <i>so-called</i>), we must make
the best of it by calling Shell-shock just the ore in the clinical
mine. To say the least, the <i>term</i> is harmless: it merely stimulates
the lay hearer to questions. These questions he must
ask of the expert. But every time that the expert suavely
states that Shell-shock is nothing but psychoneurosis, that
expert runs the risk of hurting some patient who may or not
have a psychoneurosis but has been <i>called</i> psychoneurotic.
All the while, of course, the suave expert is perfectly right&mdash;<i>statistically</i>.
In fine, the man you have called a victim of
Shell-shock is probably a victim of psychoneurosis, <i>but only
probably</i>!</p>

<p><a href="#A_PSYCHOSES_INCIDENTAL_IN_THE_WAR">Section A</a> shows how he may&mdash;not probably, but possibly&mdash;be
a victim of say ten other things. But it is not that he
has an even chance of being one of these ten other things.
As the reader watches the procession of cases in <a href="#A_PSYCHOSES_INCIDENTAL_IN_THE_WAR">Section A</a>,
he will perceive that, amongst the ten major groups there
studied, some have far greater diagnostic likelihood than
others. Thus, syphilis, epilepsy, and somatic diseases will in
the sequel prove more dangerous to our success as diagnosticians
than, e. g., feeblemindedness or even perhaps alcoholism.
But now let us look at these cases systematically, just
as if we dealt with so many cases of Railway-spine or any
other “incipient, acute, and curable” cases.</p>

<p>An officer of high rank deserts his command in a
crisis: alienists’ report.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 1.</b> (<span class="smcap">Briand</span>, February, 1915.)</h4>

<p>M. X. was an officer ranking high in the French army,
having military duties of a critical nature and of great importance
(social reasons forbid Briand’s giving informatory
details). Suffice it to say that he was brought before court-martial
for abandoning his post at the very moment when
his presence was most urgently required. He turned tail,
without taking the most elementary military precautions.</p>

<p>M. X. was passed up to alienists. He was not a case of
Shell-shock unless of the anticipatory sort. He was somatically
run-down and of lowered morale and now 65 years of age.
The campaign had been fatiguing.</p>

<p>The alienists decided that the officer had not been responsible
for his non-military acts. He had been, they found, in
a state of mental confusion at the time of desertion, such that
amnesia for his duties and heedlessness of consequences had
allowed him to leave the front without looking behind him
or securing substitution. This state of mental confusion had
been preceded by overwork and several nights of insomnia.</p>

<p>Moreover he was palpably arteriosclerotic. Blood pressure
was high. The history was one of slight shocks and a mild
hemiplegia. The confusion at the front was only the most
recent of a series of transitory attacks of confusion. At the
time of examination this high officer was actually in a state
of mild dementia.</p>

<p>M. X. was an old colonial man, malarial, and had been a
victim of syphilis.</p>

<h4><b>Case 2.</b> (<span class="smcap">Carlill</span>, <span class="smcap">Fildes</span>, and <span class="smcap">Baker</span>, July, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A naval officer, 36, during August, 1916, asserted that he
could see hundreds of submarines. At one time he imagined
that he was receiving trunk calls in the middle of the ocean.
He was admitted to Haslar, and the Wassermann reaction
of the serum was found strongly positive. The spinal fluid
was not at this time examined. The officer recovered to
some extent, was given no special treatment, and was sent
on leave.</p>

<p>He came under observation again in October, 1916, having
become very strange in his manner, on one occasion passing
water into the coal box, and talked about impending electrocution.
His ankle-jerks were found sluggish and there
was a patch of blunting to pin pricks. The diagnosis of
general paresis was made. The spinal fluid was afterward
examined and found to be negative to the Wassermann
reaction but contained 15 lymphocytes per cubic mm.</p>

<p>Three full doses of Kharsivan freed him from delusions and
left him apparently absolutely sane. It was recommended
that he should be kept at Haslar to continue treatment.
However, he had been certified insane and was therefore sent
to Yarmouth, from which he was discharged in February,
1917, having been in good mental health throughout his stay
there.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> syphilis and general paresis of military officers, as in
Cases <a href="#case1">1</a> and <a href="#case2">2</a>, Russo-Japanese experience was already at
hand. Autokratow saw paretic Russian officers sent to the
front in early but still obvious phases of disease. These
paretics and various arteriosclerotics, Autokratow saw back
in Russia in the course of a few months.</p>

<p>A German, long alcoholic and thought to be weakminded,
volunteered, but shortly had to be released from service.
He began to be forgetful and obstinate, cried, and even
appeared to be subject to hallucinations. The pupils were
unequal and sluggish. The uvula hung to the right. The
left knee-jerk was lively, right weak. Fine tremors of hands.
Hypalgesia of backs of hands. Stumbling speech. Attention
poor.</p>

<p>It appeared that he had been infected with syphilis in 1881

leg pains, regarded as due to rheumatism or neuritis. He
was invalided home after exhaustion on the great retreat.

improved greatly under rest and antisyphilitic treatment.

as minor. The tendon was sutured and the wound healed.
During the man’s convalescence he was accidentally discovered
to have an Argyll-Robertson pupil and some excess reflexes.
Neurosyphilis had probably antedated the accident. But
from the moment of this trivial injury, the disease advanced
rapidly.</p>

<p>Overwork in service; several months exacting work

</div>

<h4><b>Case 6.</b> (<span class="smcap">Boucherot</span>, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A lieutenant of Territorials, aged 41 (heredity good, anal
fistula at 30, with ulceration of penis of an unknown nature
at the same period). In 1907 when off service and married,
his wife gave birth to a child; no miscarriages. Had been a
good soldier in service before the war. The lieutenant was
called to the colors August 2, 1914, and was detached for
special duty, for the performance of which he was much
praised by the commanding officers. The work, however,
was too much for him and on April 1 he had to be evacuated
to the hospital with a ticket saying “Nervous depression
following overwork in service.” On April 14 he seemed well
enough for a convalescent camp, but, apparently through
red tape, was sent to a hospital at Orléans. On June 23 he
had to be evacuated to the Fleury annex. His eyes were dull
and features flaccid; his whole manner suggested fatigue.
His pupils were myotic, tongue tremulous, speech slow and
stumbling. Knee-jerks were exaggerated and gait difficult,
the right leg dragging. Headaches. He could not perform
the slightest intellectual work and was the victim of retrograde
and anterograde amnesia. He was aware of the decline
of his mental power and was fain to struggle against it,
becoming restless and sad. The gaps in his memory grew
deeper, he became more and more impulsive, even violent,
and had spells of excitement. Dizziness and palpitation
developed. Sometimes there were auditory and visual
hallucinations of such intense character that he tried feebly
to commit suicide with a penknife. He fell into semicoma,
and then had a number of apoplectiform attacks. W. R. +</p>

<p>Apparently the moral and physical situation of the lieutenant
was absolutely normal when the campaign began and,
as he fulfilled detail duties with absolute correctness for a
number of months, Boucherot argues that here is an instance
of general paresis <i>declanché</i> by overwork.</p>

<p>A laboring man, 42, who always strenuously denied syphilitic
infection, proceeded to France eight months after enlistment.
He had not been in France three weeks when he
dropped unconscious. He regained consciousness, but remained
stupid, dull in expression, and with memory impaired.
His speech was also impaired. There was dizziness and a
right-sided hemiplegia.</p>

<p>He was confined to bed four months and was then “boarded”
for discharge.</p>

<p>Physically, his heart was slightly enlarged both right and
left; sounds irregular; extra systoles; aortic systolic murmur
transmitted to neck; blood pressure 140:40. Precordial
pain, dyspnoea.</p>

<p>Neurologically, there was a partial spastic paralysis of the
right thigh which could be abducted, could be flexed to 120°,
and showed some power in the quadriceps. There was also
a spastic paralysis of the right arm, but the shoulder girdle
movements were not impaired. There was a slight weakness
on the right side of the face. There was no anesthesia
anywhere.</p>

<p>The deep reflexes were increased on the right side, Babinski

of three years’ standing” (a decision bearing on compensation);
but the general diagnosis remained:</p>

<p>“Cerebrospinal lues, <b>aggravated by service</b>.”</p>

<p>The picture which the medical board regarded as of at least
three years’ standing was as follows:</p>

<p>History of incontinence, shooting pains, attacks of syncope,
general weakness, facial tremor, exaggerated knee-jerks,
pupils react with small excursion. Speech and writing disorder,
perception dull, lapses of attention, memory defect,
defective insight into nature of disorder, emotional apathy.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. Was the conclusion “aggravated by service” sound?
On humanitarian grounds the victim is naturally conceded
the benefit of the doubt. But it is questionable
how scientifically sound the conclusion really was.</p>

<p>2. Could the condition come only from syphilitic infection
of at least three years’ standing? Hardly any single
symptom in this case need be of so long a standing; yet
the combination of symptoms seems by very weight of
numbers to justify the conclusion of the medical board.</p>

<h4><b>Case 9.</b> (<span class="smcap">Marie</span>, <span class="smcap">Chatelin</span>, <span class="smcap">Patrikios</span>, January, 1917.)</h4>

<p>In apparently good health a French soldier repaired to the
colors, in August, 1914, being then 23 years old.</p>

<p>Two years later, August, 1916, symptoms appeared:
speech disorder with stammering, change of character (had
become easily excitable), stumbling gait. He became more
and more preoccupied with his own affairs, grew worse, and
was sent to hospital in October, 1916.</p>

<p>He was then foolish and overhappy, especially when interviewed.
There was marked rapid tremor of face and tongue.
Speech hesitant, monotonous, and stammering to the point
of unintelligibility. His memory, at first preserved, became
impaired so that half of a test phrase was forgotten. Simple
addition was impossible and fantastic sums would be given
instead of right answers. Handwriting tremulous, letters
often missed, others irregular, unequal, and misshapen.</p>

<p>Excitable from onset, the patient now became at times
suddenly violent, striking his wife without provocation.
After visit at home, he would forget to return to hospital.
Often he would leave hospital without permission (of course
the more surprising in a disciplined soldier). No delusions.</p>

<p>Serum and fluid W. R. positive; albumin; lymphocytosis.</p>

<p>Neurological examination: Unequal pupils, slight right-side
mydriasis, pupils stiff to light, weakly responsive in
accommodation, reflexes lively, fingers tremulous on extension
of arms.</p>

<p>The patient had, December 5, 1916, an epileptiform attack
with head rotation, limb-contractions and clonic movements.
Should this soldier recover for disability obtained in service?
Marie was inclined to think military service in part responsible
for the development of the paresis. Laignel-Lavastine
thought so also, but that the amount assigned should be 5%-10%
of the maximum assignable.</p>

<p>SYPHILITIC ROOT-SCIATICA (lumbosacral
radiculitis) in a fireworks man with a French artillery
regiment.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 10.</b> (<span class="smcap">Long</span> (<span class="smcap">Dejerine’s</span> clinic), February, 1916.)</h4>

<p>No direct relation of this example of root-sciatica to the
war is claimed nor was there a question of financial reparation.</p>

<p>There was no prior injury. At the end of March, 1915,
the workman was taken with acute pains in lumbar region
and thighs, and with urgent but retarded micturition.</p>

<p>Unfit for work, he remained, however, five months with the
regiment, and was then retired for two months to a hospital
behind the lines. He reached the Salpêtrière October 12,
1915, with “double sciatica, intractable.”</p>

<p>There was no demonstrable paralysis but the legs seemed
to have “melted away,” <i>fondu</i>, as the patient said. Pains
were spontaneously felt in the lumbar plexus and sciatic
nerve regions, not passing, however, beyond the thighs.
These pains were more intense with movements of legs; but
coughing did not intensify the pains. Neuralgic points could
be demonstrated by the finger in lumbar and gluteal regions
and above and below the iliac crests (corresponding with
rami of first lumbar nerves). The inguinal region was
involved and the painful zone reached the sciatic notch and
the upper part of the posterior surface of the thigh.</p>

<p>The sensory disorder had another distribution, objectively
tested. The sacral and perineal regions were free. Anesthesia
of inner surfaces of thighs, hypesthesia of the anterior
surfaces of thighs and lower legs. The anesthesia grew more
and more marked lower down and was maximal in the feet,
which were practically insensible to all tests, including those
for bone sensation. There was a longitudinal strip of skin
of lower leg which retained sensation.</p>

<p>Position sense of toes, except great toes, was poor. There
was a slight ataxia attributable to the sensory disorder&mdash;reflexes
of upper extremities, abdominal, and cremasteric
preserved, knee-jerks, Achilles and plantar reactions absent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>The vesical sphincter shortly regained its function, though
its disorder had been an initial symptom. Pupils normal.</p>

<p>The “sciatica” here affects the lumbosacral plexus.</p>

<p>As to the syphilitic nature of this affection, there had been
at eighteen (22 years before) a colorless small induration of
the penis, lasting about three weeks. There was now evident
a small oval pigmented scar. The patient had married at
20 and had had three healthy children.</p>

<p>The lumbar puncture fluid yielded pleocytosis (120 per
cmm.). Mercurial treatment was instituted.</p>

<p>The treatment has not reduced the pains. Long thinks it
was undertaken too long (six months) after onset. The
warning for early diagnosis is manifest. There was somehow
a delay under the medical conditions of the army.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> syphilis in munition-workers Thibierge has much to
say of French conditions. Throughout his work on syphilis
in the army, he stresses the large number of venereal cases
in men mobilized for munition-work. Medical inspections
ought, according to Thibierge, imperatively to be made in
the munition-works and upon all mobilized workmen, whether
French or belonging to the Colonial contingents. These men
are under military control in France, but they have more
opportunities than the soldiers for contracting and disseminating
syphilis. They are, in point of fact, very often infected
and in a higher proportion than are the soldiers at
the front. The munition-workers should also be obliged to
report their infections to the physician, whether or no they
are under treatment by military or by private physicians.</p>

<p>Thibierge devotes a chapter to syphilis as a national danger.
Not only do available statistics prove that there is more
syphilis in the population since the outbreak of war, but
the number of married women going to special hospitals for
syphilis is abnormally high and entirely out of proportion
to the number of married women resorting to these clinics in
peace times. A certain number are contaminated by their
husbands on leave. Thibierge calls attention to the fact of
the extraordinary frequency of syphilis in young men (two
or three, sixteen to eighteen years of age, at Saint-Louis
Hospital at each consultation).</p>

</div>

<h4><b>Case 11.</b> (<span class="smcap">Kastan</span>, January, 1916.)</h4>

<p>Reports varied about a certain German soldier who came
up for discipline. Inferiors thought he was harsh and tricky.
A lieutenant declared that the man always wanted to have
proper respect paid to him, and that he was unduly excited
by trifles. The man had become latterly very nervous on
account of battle strain and protracted shelling.</p>

<p>July 28, 1915, the man, who had been drinking with comrades
the night before, was excitedly talking to an officer concerning
relief of a guard. The soldier stated, “As a sergeant
on duty with a service record of 15 years, I think it is my affair.”
The lieutenant replied, “So far as I am concerned, the matter
is settled.” The sergeant yelled, “As far as I am concerned,
it is settled also. By the way, my name is <i>Mr.</i> Vice Sergeant …,”
and with that the sergeant wrote down the
lieutenant’s words and refused to obey the lieutenant’s order
to “Stop writing.” The lieutenant drew his sword and said,
“Take your hands down.” The sergeant replied, “Surely
I am permitted to write.” Lieutenant: “Subordination;
don’t forget yourself, Vice Sergeant.…” The sergeant
jeered, “You forgot yourself anyhow;” whereupon the lieutenant:
“Well, such a thing never happened to me before.”
The sergeant, jeeringly, “Nor to me either. If I were not in
undress I should know what to do.” The lieutenant: “Vice
Sergeant …, remain here. This matter will be settled at
once.” The sergeant: “It is <i>Mr.</i> Vice Sergeant …,”
whereupon he gave his notebook to a hornblower and said,
“Write.” The lieutenant: “Stay.” The sergeant: “What,
stay here. No, I’ll not stay,” and made off. The lieutenant
called after him, “Put on your service dress and see the
captain.” He made ready but said, “This half-idiot gives
an order like that to a sergeant with 15 years’ record.”</p>

<p>The examination showed that the man had a hypalgesia.
He complained of violent headaches. He said that he had
had syphilis 10 years before; there were no bodily stigmata.</p>

<p>Regulations broken: General paresis.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 12.</b> (<span class="smcap">Kastan</span>, January, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A German 1st-lieutenant, on active service before the war,
had left the service because there was not enough for him to
do in peace times. During his war service, he became drunk
and had two soldiers bound to a doorpost, with coats unbuttoned
and without their caps&mdash;a process quite <i>verboten</i>.
While in Königsberg, he reported himself ill, and failed to
go to a designated hospital. He was accordingly treated
as a deserter. He ran up bills with landlady and servant
girls, saying that he was going to receive money from his
wife. Under hospital examination, he said he was only a
Baden man with a lively temperament. He got angry at
the phrase <i>test feeding</i>, refused food, got excited when asked
to help in the care of other patients, and wrote a letter saying,
“If it is the idea to make me nervous by removing the air
from me, by prescribing rest in bed&mdash;a punishment only
suitable for a boy who cannot keep himself neat&mdash;and such
chicaneries, these philanthropic attempts are bound to fail
on my robust peasant nerves. Of course I know that money
considerations make the stay of every paying patient desirable,
but I am really too good for that. [The expenses were
being borne by the state.] I have openly stated what is being
here done with me is foolery, and I stick to that phrase. The
food, already poor enough, is no better, when the meat of a
half-rotten cow comes twice to the table.” This patient was,
according to Kastan, a victim of general paresis.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> general paresis and delinquency, Gilles de la Tourette
long ago maintained that there was a medicolegal period in
paresis. Lépine in his work on <i>Troubles Mentales de la
Guerre</i> speaks of the unexpected frequency of general paresis
in the army, and calls attention at the outset to the medicolegal
period. The danger of overt delinquency is, in fact,
greater under military than under civilian conditions on account
of the closer surveillance of the soldier. Desertion
and thievery are the main forms.</p>

<p>Unfit for service: General paresis.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 13.</b> (<span class="smcap">Kastan</span>, January, 1916.)</h4>

<p>Kastan describes a non-commissioned officer, who came
voluntarily into the clinic. It seems that he had absented
himself (?) from the army in the suburbs of Königsberg,
September 3, 1914. He was arrested October 7th. Once
before he had been brought to Kastan’s clinic on the suspicion
of general paresis, but had been dismissed as non-paretic.
Brought in again in a condition of marked fear, he declared
that he had to fall behind his company while he was on the
march on account of a feeling of weakness. He had been
taken to a hospital and then carried to the suburbs of Königsberg,
examined, and found unfit for service.</p>

<p>He had in his 20th year become infected with syphilis, and
had recently become forgetful, subject to fears, and easily
excitable. He had been very unhappily married with a
woman who was hysterical and threatened to shoot and
poison him. He lived in a condition of continual quarrels
with her. The symptoms that he felt on the march were
numbness of the legs and a rush of blood to the head. In
the clinic, he was subject to much dreaming and raving about
the war. There was excessive perspiration.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. As to the proper interpretation of this case, details are
lacking as to the physical and laboratory side. In fact,
it would appear that the suspicion of paresis at his first
reception in a clinic was dismissed without resort to
laboratory findings.</p>

<p>There are no neurological symptoms in the case
clearly suggestive of neurosyphilis, except perhaps the
numbness of the legs. The remainder of the picture
appears to be entirely psychic. Sensory and intellectual
symptoms are missing unless we count the war
dreams and mania as intellectual. It appears wiser
to count these as emotional in the sense that they were
roused by emotion-laden memories. The fear, perspiration,
and feelings of head flush are perhaps to be
best interpreted as satellites about an emotional nucleus.</p>

<p>Hysterical chorea versus neurosyphilis.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 14.</b> (<span class="smcap">De Massary</span> and <span class="smcap">Du Sonich</span>, April, 1917.)</h4>

<p>There were various complications in the case of a lieutenant
(nervous tic in childhood; travel 23 to 30), who was at Antwerp
during the period of mobilization. He was taken there
by the Germans; was a prisoner in their hands for 55 days;
and succeeded under great strain in escaping.</p>

<p>He then entered his regiment, and, passing the examinations,
was made an adjutant, and went to the front, March,
1915. He stayed ten months in the Verdun region, under
heavy bombardment, and in June was bowled over and buried
by a 210. He seemed to be fearless, getting no sensation
from shell-bursts except a griping sensation in the bowels.</p>

<p>However, his character had altered in the direction of
irritability; and by the end of January, 1916, he had to be
evacuated for the first time from the front, for general weakness,
with the diagnoses: neurasthenia, neuralgia, dyspeptic
troubles, great general fatigue, marked depression. In fact,
at Narbonne he was asked no questions for several days on
account of his obvious depression. He was given ice-bags
for violent headaches, complete rest in bed, cacodylate and
sodium nucleinate. In two weeks he was up and about.</p>

<p>At this time appeared choreiform movements, which
reached their maximum in two or three days, whereupon he
was sent, March 4, 1916, to the neurological centre at Montpellier.
Here W. R. positive! Neosalvarsan on the second
injection (0.45 and 0.60) yielded a strong reaction, with fever,
delirium, vomiting, and then jaundice.</p>

<p>About a month later, he was given twenty more intravenous
injections, whereupon the choreic movements now
decreased, and July 15 he was given convalescence for three
months. October 15 he went back to his dépôt cured; and
October 20, on request, went to the front. He was potted
and under machine-gun fire at times during the next three
months, but the choreic movements did not reappear. January
1 he left the trenches as the division went into billets.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
January 8, suddenly, without any emotional cause, he began
to “dance” again. Accordingly, he was evacuated for the
second time, January 10, 1917, with the diagnosis: choreic
movements, especially on left; evacuate to special centre.</p>

<p>At Royallieu, a lumbar puncture showed a slight lymphocytosis.
The headache improved. He was evacuated January
24, 1917, to Val-de-Grâce, with a diagnosis: Recurrent
chorea; first attack followed commotio cerebri, nervous depression,
inequality of pupils, various pains, contracted in
the army. Another W. R. was positive. Twelve intramuscular
injections of oxygen cyanide were given, besides
baths. He was then sent to Issy-les-Moulineaux with a
diagnosis of tic. He showed choreiform movements affecting
the legs alone. When sitting, legs extended and flexed, the
knees would abduct, then adduct; the thighs flexed. When
standing, flexor movements were produced alternately on the
left and the right, the knee being raised high, sometimes
striking the patient’s hand. In walking, the thigh and lower
leg flexion was always out of proportion to the required step.
There was thus a sort of saltatory chorea limited to the legs.
The reflexes so far as they could be tested were normal save
that the left pupil was fixed to light and accommodation; the
right pupil was sluggish to light but accommodated normally.
Leucoplakia of the cheeks; nocturnal headaches; and pains
resembling lightning pains in arms and legs. Lumbar puncture,
March 26, showed blood-stained fluid, and the puncture
was followed by headache, vomiting, and slow pulse. The
fluid showed a slight lymphocytosis; W. R. negative.</p>

<p>It is clear that a diagnosis limiting itself to the leg trouble
would probably content itself with “hysterical chorea.” The
lieutenant said that when he saw people “dance” he did have
a tendency to imitate them; and when he was cured of that,
he did not want to go to Lamalou because he would see the
ataxic patients there and might fall back into his “dancing.”
However, in view of the pupillary inequality, the lymphocytosis,
the leucoplakia, the W. R., and the initial neurasthenia
and depression found in the very first hospital in which
he was examined, we probably should be entitled to consider
that general paresis played a part in the chorea.</p>

<p>Shrapnel fragment driven through skull: General
paresis.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 15.</b> (<span class="smcap">Hurst</span>, April, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A private, 31, was wounded December 7, 1916, by a shrapnel
fragment which entered the skull above the left ear and
lodged in the brain, an inch above and 2½ inches below the
middle of the right orbital margin. At Netley, December 30,
he proved to show a complete internal and external left sided
ophthalmoplegia, with the exception of the external rectus.
On the right side, there was a complete paralysis of the superior
rectus and a partial paralysis of the inferior rectus and levator
palpebrae superioris. There was a paresis of the left side of the
face. The right plantar reflex was said to have been extensor
at the clearing station, but at Netley it and the other reflexes
proved to be normal, as were the optic. The patient was
stuporous and had incontinence of urine and feces for two
days. Shortly after admission, slurring of speech with a long
latent period occurred. It was clear that the shrapnel fragment
must have passed far above the crus, and it was not
plain how isolated lesions of the third and seventh nerve
nuclei could have been brought about without injury of the
long tracts of the crus.</p>

<p>The Wassermann reaction of the serum was negative, but
that of the spinal fluid was positive. Iodide and mercury
secured considerable improvement in the mental condition
and some diminution in the paralysis. The patient is now
extremely pleased with himself and has a speech suggestive
of paresis.</p>

<h4><b>Case 16.</b> (<span class="smcap">Babonneix</span> and <span class="smcap">David</span>, June, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A bullet glancing from his gun barrel November 28, 1914,
wounded a man in the head, whereupon he lost consciousness
and was carried to a hospital and trephined. On coming to,
he found that he could not hear and felt pains; but the latter
disappeared in a few months. He was given sedentary
employment and did his work properly until February, 1917,
when he suddenly became sad, wept, slept poorly, stopped
eating, had an absent air, and began to complain of his head.
He passed whole days without moving, in a sort of stupor,
which was then followed by a hypomaniacal agitation in
which he walked furiously up and down in the room and threw
objects about.</p>

<p>He was found subject to a generalized tremor and he was
distinctly weaker on the right side. The tendon reflexes
were excessive. The bony sensibility, as well as the pain and
temperature sense, and the position and stereognostic senses
were completely abolished on the right side. The scar lay
on the left side. It was deep and very sensitive to pressure,
so that if it was touched ever so slightly the patient began to
weep. X-ray indicated loss of substance in the posterior part
of the left parietal region. Remains of the projectile were
found subcutaneously in the right supraorbital region. The
W. R. of the serum was positive. There was no lymphocytosis
in the spinal fluid.</p>

<p>Interpretation of this case is manifestly difficult. Four
possibilities exist: Syphilis, manic depressive psychosis, traumatic
brain disease, and functional shock effects. More
than two years had passed between the trauma and the
change of character.</p>

<p>A soldier, 31, sustained fracture of the occiput from shell-burst,
and thereafter showed confusion and total loss of

and clots, whereupon the man returned practically to normal.
He developed, however, a few seizures, in which he struggled,
fell, and lost consciousness, afterward suffering from headache.
The tendon reflexes were increased. The occipital
cicatrix was a little depressed and slightly painful on pressure.</p>

<p>Lumbar puncture showed a very slight lymphocytosis (5
to 6 cells), practically negative globulin reaction, and a low
albumin titer. There were no signs of syphilis in the eyes.
The W. R. in the serum was strongly positive. Very possibly
the traumatic phenomena in this case can be safely disengaged
from the syphilitic phenomena.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> the mechanism by which trauma evokes or accelerates
the course of neurosyphilis, it is probable that most neuropathologists
believe that the <i>commotio cerebri</i> causes sundry
chemical or physical effects in the nerve tissues such that
spirochetes are moved into new and more dangerous places,
or such that more appropriate food is supplied to the organisms,
which then begin to multiply. Whether the organisms
live in a kind of symbiosis in the tissues under ordinary circumstances
in the pre-paretic period of the development of
neurosyphilis, is unknown. Possibly fat embolism should
be added to the list of possible causes of the hastening of
the neurosyphilitic process. Fat embolism in the brain has
been shown by various authors to be accompanied by minute
hemorrhages, in the midst of which by proper stains the
fat embolism can be made out.</p>

<h4><b>Case 18.</b> (<span class="smcap">Boucherot</span>, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A soldier in the Territorial Infantry, 42, a gardener who went
to taverns, as he said, “like everybody else,” a widower with
two children, a good worker though irascible, had had syphilis
as a youth. He was called to the colors at the outbreak of the
war and got on well despite tremendous strain. March 9,
1915, he was in a bayonet charge with his regiment and was
bowled over by a shell of which a fragment wounded him
above the knee and several fragments in the thorax. All
these fragments were extracted at a temporary hospital,
March 11. The man now became strange, refused to obey
orders and did a number of peculiar things so that he was
sent to Orléans temporary hospital whence he was evacuated
to Fleury Asylum, March 19. He refused to give up his
things because he was the master. He did not want to go to
bed and wanted to keep on walking constantly. He was
without sense of shame, satisfied with himself, grandiose as
to his millions in bank and the thirty-six decorations he
believed had been awarded him. He mistook the identity of
the landscape and of the people about him.</p>

<p>Tongue tremulous; pupils unequal; knee-jerks exaggerated;
dysarthria; gaps in memory. In May occurred a number
of violent reactions.</p>

<p>In June, however, there was a remission; the ideas of
grandeur disappeared first, then the tremors and reflex disorder
and finally the speech disorder. There was a slight
seizure at this point and the man said he had had another
such just before he came to the army. July 20 he was invalided
out much improved.</p>

<p>In this case of general paresis there is, besides the syphilis,
also alcoholism to consider, so that it is not entirely plain
that the exertions of campaign liberated the paresis.</p>

<p>Examination of the blood serum yielded a strongly positive
Wassermann reaction.</p>

<p>According to Schuster, the explosion of the shell had
brought about hemorrhage in vessels supplying the region
of the eye muscle nerves or nuclei. The reason for the selection
of these vessels for rupture due to shell explosion is,
according to Schuster, that the vessels were probably already
syphilitically diseased.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> hemorrhages in the neighborhood of the oculomotor
nuclei, the phenomena of polioencephalitis may be recalled.
In that disease, the predisposition to hemorrhage is presumed
to be alcoholic, as the cases of ophthalmoplegia of this group
almost always appear in alcoholics. However, the first case
of hemorrhagic superior polioencephalitis was a non-alcoholic
one of Gayet (1875), in which the symptoms followed three
days after a boiler explosion.</p>

<p>A tabetic lieutenant “shell-shocked” into paresis?</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 20.</b> (<span class="smcap">Donath</span>, July, 1915.)</h4>

<p>An apparently competent German professor in an intermediate
school, a lieutenant of infantry reserves, 33 years
old, on the 17th August, 1914, was stunned for a while by
the shock of a cannon-firing 25 feet away. Urination became
difficult. Headaches and limb pains ensued, with paralysis
of fingers, gastric troubles, forgetfulness, especially for names,
insomnia, and general scattering of mental faculties.</p>

<p>Neurologically, the pupils were irregular, left larger than
right; Argyll-Robertson reaction. Right knee-jerk livelier
than left. Achilles reactions absent. Slow and dissociated
pain reactions in feet, lower thighs and lower quarter of upper
thighs, with hypalgesia or analgesia. Station good; gait
steady. Mentally depressed, slow of thought. Speech poor
and of indistinct construction (mild dementia). Calculation
ability poor. No pleasure in work.</p>

<p>Wassermann reaction of serum weakly positive.</p>

<p>It seems that for a year the patient had been subject to
spells of anger. He was irritated by his wife who had been
nervous since an earthquake.</p>

<p><i>On the occasion of the earthquake</i>, 1911, the patient himself
had had a spell of <i>difficulty with urination</i>. The spell had
lasted two or three months. The patient had had a chancre
in 1902, “cured” in four or five weeks with xeroform. In
1908, when about to marry, he had had six mercurial inunctions.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> tabes, Lépine shows that tabetics are numerous. They
are numerous among officers and also in the auxiliary service,
in which latter tabetics are maintained on desk duty. Perhaps
they had been admitted to such work as unable to
march or fight, on the basis of having had so-called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span> “rheumatism.”</p>

<p>An artilleryman, 38, had a large calibre shell explode very
near him and afterward could not hear the whistle of a shell
without falling down in a generalized tremor, sweating profusely,
urinating involuntarily, in a mental state approaching
stupidity. Here was a case that might be regarded as one
of morbid cowardice in a psychopath, following violent
emotion.</p>

<p>The artilleryman proved to be a victim of tabes and of
general paresis. The incontinence of urine under the influence
of emotion was nothing but an effect of tabetic
sphincter disorder. The crisis of cowardice proved nothing
but an initial symptom of general paresis.</p>

<h4><b>Case 23.</b> (<span class="smcap">Pitres</span> and <span class="smcap">Marchand</span>, November, 1916.)</h4>

<p>Innkeeper B., 36, a shell-shock and burial victim June 20,
1915, was looked on by a number of physicians as a case of
genuine tabes.</p>

<p>Even eight months after the episode, he still showed (when
observed by Pitres and Marchand, February 3, 1916)
absence of knee-jerks and Achilles jerks, a slight swaying in
the Romberg position, pupils sluggish to light, incoördination,
delayed sensations. There was also a history of pains in the
legs, compared by the patient to those of sciatica. These
pains came in crises, the longest of which had lasted 30 hours.</p>

<p>It seems that this soldier’s troubles began the day after his
shock with a feeling of swollen feet and of cotton wool under
them. He stayed on service, however, walking with increasing
difficulty.</p>

<p>At the time of his evacuation, July 10, he could walk with
great difficulty. “Strips of lead were between his legs.” He
could hardly control movements in the dark, or descend
stairs. Often his legs would bend under him. Vesical function
sluggish.</p>

<p>After a few months the patient could walk better. In
February, 1916, he walked thrusting his legs forward trembling,
and dragging toes a little. He could not support himself
on either leg. Jerkiness and incoördination in extension or
flexion of leg on thigh.</p>

<p>The muscular weakness was decidedly against tabes or at
all events a pure tabes. The incoördination proved to be due,
not to loss of position sense (which was intact) but to unsteady
muscular contractions. Deep sensibility was intact.</p>

<p>There were no mental symptoms. There was a slight
hesitation in speech and doubling of syllables, but nothing
demonstrable with test phrases.</p>

<p>The serum W. R. was positive.</p>

<p>A private, 31, was in the retreat from Mons, was blown up
by a shell and buried in May, 1915, went back to the front
after two months leave, was knocked unconscious by a shell
December, 1916. He came to himself two days later in the
hospital, but remained confused and lethargic. In England,
December 21, his legs were still weak and walking was
unsteady. The right pupil reacted neither to light nor to
accommodation and was irregular, eccentric, and dilated.
The left pupil showed the Argyll-Robertson reaction. There
was early primary optic atrophy. The right knee-jerk was
slightly exaggerated. The vibration sense was reduced over
sacrum and malleoli. At this time the man’s mental condition
was practically normal.</p>

<p>The Wassermann reaction of the serum and spinal fluid
proved positive. Improvement followed rest, iodide, mercury,
and seven injections of salvarsan. By the middle of
February he was able to walk well. The right pupil regained
its power to react to accommodation, but remained inactive
to light. Meanwhile, the left pupil had regained a slight
power to react to light.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> treatment of syphilis, both Thibierge and Lépine give
warning of some bad results with arsenobenzol treatment,
though Thibierge states that the number of serious accidents
and especially of deaths has diminished more and more
now that no arsenobenzol (drug No. 914) is given. Encephalitis
is the gravest of the untoward results of injection,
sometimes appearing in young and vigorous subjects. Hemorrhagic
encephalitis appears to occur more frequently after
the second injection than after the first, and according to
Thibierge may be especially suspected in subjects who after
the first injection present much fever, congestion of face,
and cutaneous eruptions. Treatment in these cases should
be suspended or given in moderate doses.</p>

<p>A corporal, 26, blown up by a shell December 7, 1916, was
admitted to the hospital on the 13th, dazed and with symptoms
of a left-sided hemiplegia of organic origin. The right
pupil was larger than the left. There was a bruise of the
scalp in the right parietal region. The man had had syphilis
at 16. The Wassermann reaction of the serum was strongly
positive. Rest, salvarsan, mercury, and iodides were given,
and the general symptoms and hemiplegia gradually disappeared,
until on December 12 there was only a moderate
weakness of the left side, with knee-jerks in excess, abdominal
reflexes absent, and the Babinski reaction.</p>

<p>The Wassermann reaction was still strongly positive.
Salvarsan, mercury, and iodide were continued. January 6,
1917, the plantar reflex had become flexor. The abdominal
reflex returned. Babinski’s second sign (combined flexion of
thigh and pelvis) was now the only evidence of organic
disease. Further antisyphilitic treatment removed this sign
also. February 28, the man was discharged fit for light duty,
with unequal pupils and positive Wassermann reaction, and
a complete amnesia for the four weeks following his blowing
up in the trenches.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> fitness for light duty, see remarks on <a href="#case20">Case 20</a> concerning
desk duty for certain tabetics.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> the premature or unexpectedly early appearance of
neurosyphilis under war conditions, the early claims of some
authors have not been maintained. In the above instance,
the infection was at 16 and the shell explosion occurred at
26, namely, at about the right interval for the development
of neurosyphilitic signs. Gerver states that military service
brings out the lesions of paresis earlier than they would
otherwise come. Bonhoeffer has been unable to show that
cerebrospinal syphilis is favored in its development by the
exhaustion factor.</p>

Recovery.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 26.</b> (<span class="smcap">Pitres</span> and <span class="smcap">Marchand</span>, November, 1916.)</h4>

<p>June 19, 1915, a shell exploded some distance from Lieutenant
R. He remembers the gaseous smell, the bursting of
several shells nearby and a sensation of being lifted into the
air. When he recovered consciousness, he was in hospital
at Paris-Plage, covered with bruises and scratches. They
told him he had been delirious and had vomited and spat
blood.</p>

<p>June 24, his wife came to see him, but this visit he could
not remember. Nor could his wife at first recognize him, he
was so thin. He roused a few moments and recognized his
wife, but relapsed into torpor again. Speech was difficult
and ideas confused.</p>

<p>A few days later he was able to rise; but his mental status
grew worse, especially as to speech and writing, the latter
quite illegible. There was insomnia, or, if he slept, war dreams.</p>

<p>August 7, he began a period of five months’ convalescence
passed with his family, depressed, given to spells of weeping,
confined to bed or couch, unable to “find words,” conscious
of his state and troubled about it, speaking of nothing but
the war, and afraid to go out for fear of ambuscade. There
was at first a slight lameness of the right leg. Although he
could walk, he felt pain in the knee on flexing the right leg
on the thigh. He walked holding this leg in extension.</p>

<p>On going back to the colors, he was immediately evacuated
to the <i>Centre Neurologique</i> at Bordeaux, January 20, 1916.</p>

<p>Examination found a bored, impatient, irritated man, vexed
that a man who was not sick should be sent up “<i>comme fou</i>.”</p>

<p>Omitting negative details, neurological examination showed
slight lameness as above, body stiff and movements jerky,
difficult, unsteady gait. The lieutenant could stand for some
time on either leg. Tongue and face tremulous during speech.
Limbs moderately tremulous, especially in the performance
of test movements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>Knee-jerks and Achilles jerks absent. Other reflexes, including
pupillary, normal. Segmentary hypalgesia of right
leg, especially about knee. Tremulous speech and writing.
Patient would stop short in speaking for lack of words.</p>

<p>Malnutrition. Appetite good, but a bursting feeling after
meals.</p>

<p>Skin dry, scaly on legs, fissured on fingers.</p>

<p>Serum W. R. negative. Fluid not examined.</p>

<p><b>Mental examination.</b> Conscious and complaining of his
troubles, Lieutenant R. claimed persistently that he was not
sick. Memory for recent events was in general poor. Errands
easily forgotten. Lost in the street. Complaint of
corpse odors round him. Everybody is looking at him and
making fun of him. He was apt to insult bystanders. He
was afraid of German spies. Things in shops angered him
as they seemed to him to be of German manufacture.</p>

<p>There were frequent periods of depression, with pallor and
no spontaneous speech for some hours to a half-day. Headaches
coming on and stopping suddenly.</p>

<p>As to diagnosis, the first impression, say Pitres and Marchand,
was that of general paresis. The progress of symptoms
after the shock was consistent with this diagnosis. The
mental state and the physical findings seemed consistent,
although the pupils were normal. His partial insight into
his symptoms was not inconsistent with the diagnosis. He
had a characteristic self-confidence. There had been four
stillbirths (two twins); two children are alive, 11 and 13.
Typhoid fever at 30. Syphilis denied. No mental disease
in the family.</p>

<p>The patient had never done military duty, having been
invalided for “right apex.” But he had volunteered and been
accepted in September, 1914.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>How was Lieutenant R. cured? Apparently by rest in
the <i>Centre Neurologique</i>. Pitres and Marchand do not
speak of the subtle relation between mental state and
the idea of non-return to military service. This motive
might still work even if Lieutenant R. kept protesting
sincerely that he wanted to go back into military
service.</p>

<h4><b>Case 27.</b> (<span class="smcap">Karplus</span>, February, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A captain, 34, was under much stress and strain in the field
and gave himself over to excesses of alcohol and tobacco.
August 25, 1914, at the Krasnik battle he suddenly saw at his
right a gleam of fire and was afterward able to remember very
distinctly the words of a lieutenant standing near by, “The
man is dead.” Three or four hours later he came to himself
at a relief post, vomited and bled a good deal from nose and
mouth. He heard later that he had been thrown on his
back.</p>

<p>Manual tremors and general pains developed in the next
few days. Two weeks after the accident a slight nystagmus
on looking to the left appeared, but there was otherwise no
disorder of head or extremities. He was able to sit up, supported
by his arms, and he was able to contract his abdominal
muscles normally. As for his legs, active movements
were limited and weak. He could not lift his legs. The
paralysis was more marked distally. He could walk with the
support of two persons, but was unable to lift his feet from the
ground. The right upper abdominal reflex was elicited, and
both patellar reflexes were tolerably active. Cremasteric and
plantar reflexes were absent. Neither of the Achilles jerks
could be produced. There was hypesthesia and hypalgesia
of the lower extremities, and of the back up to a horizontal
line corresponding with the ninth dorsal segment; thermo-hyperesthesia
and disorder of vibration sense in the lower
legs. Both the motor and the sensory disorders were more
marked on the right than the left. Insomnia and battle
dreams.</p>

<p>The gait disorder and paresis gradually improved. There
was no alimentary glycosuria and adrenalin produced no
mydriasis. In the course of several weeks the patient gained
seven kilograms, began to sleep well and showed gradual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
improvement in his gait and in the execution of various
movements with his feet. The abdominal reflexes were now
both present, but there were no plantar reflexes and the
Achilles were still both absent. The sensory disorder remained
unchanged, so far as the skin was concerned, but the
deep sensibility improved. Both legs from the knee down
were somewhat cold.</p>

<p>This man had had syphilis at twenty-two, had gone through
an inunction cure, and repeated W. R.’s came through negative.
He had suffered from vomiting spells and anxiety feelings
for a number of years which had been diagnosed by
physicians as cardiac neurosis. Yet for a year before going
into the war he had felt absolutely well.</p>

had no remembrance of what happened up to July, 1915,
when in hospital at Tunis he felt “born again.”</p>

<p>Examined in January, 1916, it was found that he had a
left hemiplegia (in fact, he had a syphilitic hemiplegia on that
side, several years before, which had disappeared under antisyphilitic
treatment). This hemiplegia passed, but he then
had crises of depression due to his despair at not being able
to know who he was and what he was doing. He could
speak French and Spanish, and knew from the hospital ticket
that he was born in Spain; but he had no idea what had
happened to his relatives or what he was doing in France.
He had, however, a very correct idea of what happened during
six months after July, 1915.</p>

<p>One morning in April, 1916, his old memories came back
all of a sudden on waking. The gap was filled up to the moment
of the shock. There was no gap left except for a period
of about 25 days following the shock. He now found that he
knew a little English but that he had lost his stenography
as well as his professional skill at typewriting.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> French statistics for the occurrence of general paresis,
Lautier found 27 cases in 426. Early in the war, Boucherot
at Fleury received four cases of paresis among 107 cases; the

in Italy received two cases out of 270.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> hemiplegia in this case, it may be inquired whether the
hemiplegia which developed after the shell explosion on the
same side of the body on which the patient had a true syphilitic
hemiplegia, was really syphilitic or not. Was it not,
perhaps, in some sense psychogenic? A similar question may

<h4><b>Case 29.</b> (<span class="smcap">Laignel-Lavastine</span> and <span class="smcap">Courbon</span>, March,
1916.)</h4>

<p>A soldier of the class of 1906 underwent shell-shock August
13, 1914, regaining consciousness 20 days later, but blind. The
light of the shellburst, he said, was the last thing he had seen.</p>

<p>For sixteen months, he was transferred from hospital to
hospital, looked on sometimes as blinded; sometimes as
feigning. Finally, on the isolation service of Maison-Blanche,
December 15, 1915, he received an ophthalmologist’s diagnosis
namely, hysterical amaurosis. At this time there were found:
stereotyped winking, with slight lachrymation, a slight left
external strabismus, limitation in movement of all the extrinsic
muscles of both eyes, especially to the right and in
convergence and elevation; pupils slightly smaller than
normal&mdash;and the general impression of a genuinely blinded
or amblyopic subject. He seemed to be able to distinguish
faint whitish spots, without contour or color, in objects
brought to a distance of at least 40 cm.</p>

<p>He also complained of bad feelings inside his head on the
left side, and he proved to have a left-sided hemianesthesia
of hysterical nature. There were no other sensory disorders
and no reflex disorders.</p>

<p>The nasolabial fold on the left side was flattened out, and
there was also on the same side a slight diminution in the
lower abdominal skin reflexes, and no response to plantar
stimulation. Examination of the mouth showed leucoplakia,
and the history showed that the man’s fifth child
was born before term and died at two months. Lumbar
puncture yielded lymphocytosis (55 cells) and an excess of
albumin. The fundus examination showed a slight papillary
disorder, suggesting a retrobulbar affection of the optic nerves.</p>

<p>However, the preservation of the pupil reflexes seemed to
indicate that nine-tenths, at least, of the amaurosis was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
functional. After mercurial treatment the headache grew
less and the man was able to see somewhat better with his
right eye.</p>

<p>Laignel-Lavastine and Courbon suggest that there was a
dynamic disorder in this case, bearing the same relation to
vision as mental confusion bears to the process of ideation.

in such wise that the victims can, as it were, passively hear

<p>A marine, 26, on land service March, 1916, was buried by
the explosion of a large calibre shell which killed most of his
comrades. He remained for a time in a sort of lethargy.
Coming to, he found himself victim of a right hemiplegia and
deafmutism, which phenomena vanished under electricity.</p>

<p>In July, however, he had to be sent to a hospital on account
of his sufferings, which received the diagnoses <i>commotio
cerebri</i>, disorder of consciousness, disorientation, delirium,
amnesia, over-emotionality. He was sent back to the front
in December, 1916, but promptly reported sick, with headaches
and insomnia.</p>

<p>Examination showed nonorganic nervous disorders, consisting
in a variable and patchy anesthesia of the legs, anesthesia
of the conjunctiva and pharynx, and over-reaction,
with sighing, during the course of the examination. The
organic signs were: exaggeration of tendon reflexes, equilibration
disorder, and incapacity to stand on one foot or
execute a half turn or to stand still with eyes closed, and
disorder of position sense. The lumbar puncture showed no
cells, a slight globulin reaction, and an albumin titer within
the normal. There was a leucoplakia and a positive W. R.
The man was emaciated, febrile, and showed signs, with the
X-ray, of bronchial lymph node disease. According to Babonneix
and David, the normality of the fluid indicates that the
phenomena here were Shell-shock phenomena, despite the
indisputable syphilis of the blood serum.</p>

<p>A soldier, Colonial, 29, was twice in the 6th Army neurological
centre. The first time, February, 1916, he was under
observation for astasia-abasia, having been invalided twice
for this disease,&mdash;once in 1915. This man had had syphilis
at 21, and was then taken care of at Saint-Louis Hospital and
at Cochin. A volunteer for the duration of war, September,
1914, he had intermittent disorders of station and walking,
which caused his invaliding January, 1915. As the trouble
stopped, he asked to go back to the front in September, but
the same difficulty reappeared with fatigue, and he was sent
to the army neurological centre. When standing, there was
a ceaseless trembling of the whole body but especially of the
legs, with tendency to propulsion. In walking also, there
was a trepidant abasia, sometimes dizziness, and even a
sudden fall. Standing on one foot he trembled and fell.</p>

<p>Examined on his back, muscular strength was found intact
in all limbs, and there was no trembling or incoördination
or intention tremor in the performance of any movements,
though there was a slight trembling of the raised fingers and
hand. Reflexes were normal. The right pupil was dilated;
the left pupil reacted sluggishly. There were lateral nystagmiform
movements to the left. Caloric nystagmus appeared
from the right ear in 15 seconds, from the left in 30. Rotatory
nystagmus appeared in 35 seconds on both sides. Lumbar
puncture yielded a fluid with a slight lymphocytosis; albumin,
.3 grams; chloride, 7.30; sugar normal.</p>

<p>Rest in bed improved the astasia-abasia, and the man was
sent back to his corps, February 20, 1916. He came back
March 16, having had a dizzy spell, with suffocation feeling
and a fall, whereupon the trepidant astasia-abasia had reappeared.
There were none of the so-called defensive reflexes.
The neuromuscular excitability of gastrocnemii was
less on the right than on the left. A von Graefe sign was
sometimes found; no diplopia save on looking far to right.</p>

<p>Lay reflections on syphilis: Suicidal attempts.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 32.</b> (<span class="smcap">Colin</span> and <span class="smcap">Lautier</span>, July, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A man was called to the auxiliaries at the outbreak of the
war, and served as stretcher-bearer at the Marne. He then
became an attendant at the Grand-Palais. Acquiring gonorrhoea,
he was cared for but he grew depressed. The blood
was examined and the W. R. found positive. The physician
immediately made known the result without circumlocution,
and knowing vaguely that the W. R. meant syphilis, the
patient felt an irresistible impulse to suicide, and cut his
throat. It seems that he had often before said that if he
got syphilis he would kill himself. Recovering from his
wound, he was invalided to Villejuif, Sept. 19, 1916, breathing
through a cannula and responding to questions in writing.
He had always been a nervous and emotional man, a farmer
in Auvergne; he was married and the father of several
children.</p>

<p>Examination showed that the recurrent nerves had been
cut and that the man must needs always breathe through the
cannula. In point of fact, the W. R., only partially positive
at the outset, did not indicate syphilis, and the gonorrhoea
was now cured. But though the patient knew these facts, his
hypochondria persisted, basing itself upon the suicidal wound.
He said that his larynx had been stolen and he wondered
why. He said that he had violent crises of suffocation, though
there was, as a matter of fact, no difficulty with his breathing.
Verdigris, he said, was forming on his cannula. Self-accusations
about the suicide developed. On being transferred
to his department asylum, he made a suicidal attempt
on the trip.</p>

<p>Of course the gonorrhoea may have served as a partial
factor in the genesis of the case, and his own mental attitude
toward the contraction of syphilis may have been another
factor.</p>

<p>The imitation of chancre.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 33.</b> (<span class="smcap">Pick</span>, July, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A married German farmer, 32, was in Prague hospital in
1908 during his period of military service and was then
treated by inunction for a local chancre. He was given mercurial
injections a year later for rash.</p>

<p>In 1912, he had signs of syphilis in the mouth.</p>

<p>He was sent home from service in 1913, with ulcers of hand.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the war he was found to have ulcers on
the knee, legs, and mouth, and was sent home for six months.</p>

<p>Again called up in 1915, the ulcers were still in evidence; he
got inunctions in a military hospital four months.</p>

<p>He was sent to his corps in July and had no relapse until
July, 1916, when he was detailed for active service. Thereupon,
ulcers began on the left hand and right leg. He reported
sick, but was sent nevertheless to the front. In
hospital he was found to have several scars about one inch
across on each leg, on the dorsum of the left hand, at the
right of the left index finger, and elsewhere. These scars
were deeply pigmented. <i>One of them was square!</i> There
were other recent ulcers that closely resembled tertiary ulcers.
The most recent of these ulcers was angular, intensely red,
and showed remains of a collapsed vesicle. There was a
deep dark scab on the mucous membrane of the left cheek.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that these ulcers were produced by some
caustic, the nature of which remains unknown. The patient
had, however, been able to evade military obligation during
peace time and for two years during war time.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> simulation, according to Pick, some 5 to 7 per cent
venereal diseases in the German army have been simulations.
Gonorrhoea is simulated by soap, balanitis by cantharides,
soft chancre by soap and mercuric or mercurous chloride
mixed, hard chancre by a fluid or powder containing
NaOH, Na<sub>2</sub>CO, and NaCl. Secondary syphilitic signs are
imitated by cantharides or garlic, producing scrotal dermatitis.
Tertiaries are imitated with caustics.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I am here to stay a month. Believe me, it is better
here than in the army. There is a rule that we may eat
as much as we can and everything is of the very best.
The servants treat us like brothers. Do not think it
is a nuisance to be inside four walls with a wee bit of a
garden. No, indeed! But I have got to act the fool
and from the very first day I began to play and act
crazy with a kitten, so that if you had seen me you
would say: “Ramón is really crazy.” Rosina, dear,
to avoid paying taxes you have got to be a smuggler.
And now that I am at the ball I have got to dance.
I want to see if after all the suffering I cannot get
something better. I am better off here than at the
regiment. I sleep in a fine warm bed, and they have
only cold straw; I have good food and drink and plenty of
milk, and they have poor food and drink and so little.</p>

<p>“I expect to go home in about three weeks. I
would have been there before if some fool of a spy at
our place had held his tongue and minded his own
business. At the same time, Rosina, dear, remember
what I told you at Leghorn: that they had some officers
sent there to get information and instead of going home
they asked somebody else and were told that I had
never been sick and had never had neurasthenia.
When this information was got from the officers I was
called to the office and they read to me that all that I
had said and done was not true. I kept on acting the
fool, and as they were still doubtful they sent me here,
where there is a professor who passes me every morning
in the garden and says: “How are you?” I always
say: “I am the same,” acting like a crazy man. Let
me tell you, Rosina dear, not to say anything contrary
to this in your letters because they open and read
everything in order to find out everything that happens
and everything that is said. Now what you must do is
to ask me how I am feeling, and whether my headaches
are gone, and whether I have them all the time as
formerly, and any other trifle that will help me.”</p>

Patient said he was not strong enough for this service. In 1914
the Council reconsidered the case and put him into a regiment
of infantry. He could not be given military instruction or
execute the most simple drilling manual. He said that 4
plus 2 equalled 7; 4 plus 3 equalled 5. He was of an excellent
character, very docile and easily directed. He did all his
comrades’ barracks work and was very proud because, as
he said, “I do everything they tell me to do.” He was
happy in working, everybody was good to him, but he had
no comrades. He had no general knowledge and knew nothing

<p><i>Re</i> imbeciles, Colin, Lautier and Magnac found amongst
1000 soldiers entering Villejuif, 53 imbeciles. Twenty-four
of them had been either exempt or retired at the outset of
the war, when military surgeons had reviewed them and
considered them fit for service. Several of the 29 others
also had shown previous evidence of imbecility.</p>

<p>Of course, French military surgeons may have felt that a
number of these men would be of just such service in barracks
and otherwise as <a href="#case37">Case 37</a> (Pruvost). But for one or
two cases like Cases <a href="#case37">37</a> and <a href="#case41">41</a> of Pruvost, there are great
numbers of other imbeciles who prove quite useless in the
army. Two of the Villejuif cases had been volunteers: one
volunteer declared that, if he had been intelligent, he never
would have enlisted! Ten cases proved unable to use a
gun; one turned his gun upon his mates. One regularly
forgot the password. One (see <a href="#case42">Case 42</a> of Lautier) thought
the war too long and tried to take command of the company
in order to finish the war one way or the other. Three of
the imbeciles had to be evacuated for desertion (unmotivated
fugues); two of them cursed their officers. Some of
the imbeciles had an emotional diarrhoea throughout their
service.</p>

<p>Colin suggests that line officers and military surgeons
ought to agree that these men are not fit for service, and that
the civil authorities of the home towns should advise the
review boards about known imbeciles and criminals. In
point of fact, previous knowledge of imbecility could have
been obtained quite readily in 27 of the 53 cases observed
by Colin.</p>

</div>

<h4><b>Case 38.</b> (<span class="smcap">Laignel-Lavastine</span> and <span class="smcap">Ballet</span>, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A jockey of Nîmes, 31, entered the service May 15, 1917.
He retired before the war. He was in the auxiliaries at the
moment of mobilization. Nothing is known as to any pathological
episodes in his past. He said he had been a poor
scholar, had left the primary school at eleven hardly knowing
how to write or spell, but he had a lively imagination and was
a happy-go-lucky youth, playing many tricks on the trades
people. He tried a variety of ideas in the industrial or commercial
world with very varying success. He had a mechanical
taste. The Colonial Exposition at Marseilles caused
him to float a variety of projects, from that of having the
visitors photographed on a camel to the sale of lemonade.
He said he had been a jockey and then a trainer and had
finally become a valet de jockey at Maisons Laffitte. He was
a gambler and invented a “system.” He made various
inventions in relation to horses. At the end of 1914 he had
plans for a bomb thrower and placed his discovery at the
service of the War Minister. He was not discouraged by the
lack of success of the bomb thrower. He now made an
aerial torpedo carrier. He had the idea of the tanks.
However, he found the secret of his torpedo carrier printed
in a magazine. There was a slight difference between the
German apparatus and his own.</p>

<p>From this time he began to be mistrustful, and now he
jealously avoided entering into any details about his inventions
and he did not let his officers see his plans. The Commandant
offered to give a place in the safe to his documents,
but he could not embrace the offer. He now invented a
counter-torpedo machine. He went on leave to Paris, asked
an audience of the Minister of Marine, who put him in
relation to the Committee on Inventions, who put him off,
desiring that he should forward all his plans. He emerged
from one of his interviews so excited that there was a scandal
on the public street and the police commissary evacuated him
to Val-de-Grâce, but the patient says he does not remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
this incident. He came on service of Laignel-Lavastine
May 15. He shortly wrote again to the Minister, who
again referred him to the Committee on Inventions. He
protested to the President of the Republic and wrote directly
to the King of England, who referred him to the Military
Administration. He is now occupied in creating a machine
to destroy the first line trenches and continues to write to
the Ministry. He has documents buried underground in a
secret place. He still talks with great vivacity of his discoveries.</p>

<p>According to Laignel-Lavastine, we deal with a feeble-minded
person who has for many years had a <i>délire raisonnant</i>
of the inventing group.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> feeblemindedness in the British Army, Shuttleworth

1915. The institutional “children” were in general good at
drilling and obeying. One of them, given to lying and
stealing, got into constant trouble in Flanders.</p>

<p>Sir George Savage stated that he had sometimes run the
risk of allowing enlistment of men who had shown earlier
in life a weakness for lying and pilfering, and remarked that
such men might make good soldiers. A case like the above
(<a href="#case38">38</a>) would run counter to this view. On this matter, see
below <a href="#case183">Case 183</a> (Henderson), one of pathological lying.</p>

even before the war, he deserted. He said, in explanation,
that he had lost his way, and he was being examined mentally
when mobilization began.</p>

<p>He looked ape-like, with spread ears; had a low forehead, a
head flattened behind, an asymmetrical face, prognathous

hedges, earning 22 sous a day but in no case mixing with the
police, was examined for physical inefficiency at 20 years.
He wanted to enlist but was refused. He insisted and was
very proud of the fact that he got in as the Major said
to them, “Let him go in.” He could hardly read, write or
calculate but was by reason of his adventurous life full of
practical resources. He was irascible and frequently <i>crimed</i>,
whereupon he would cry under the Captain’s window, “Robber
band, idiots, I shall write to the Minister.” He was
passionately fond of military life, though he had but the
vaguest notions about the commands, the names of generals
and the like. He wanted to drill. His comrades played
practical jokes upon him asking him to look for a trajectory,
for the squad’s umbrella and the key to the drill ground.
They also told him he had been proposed to be corporal,
whereupon he was greatly overjoyed and immediately sewed
stripes on his sleeve and began to give commands. He said
if they put him among the auxiliaries he would throw the
adjutant in the water. He sang and swung his gun with
joy when he went to the front. He thought there were stripes
hanging to the barbed wire and wanted to pick as many
as possible. Such a man may be safely sent to the front
although he will bear watching. At the date of report
this man had been at the front two months doing very well.</p>

He was on guard duty until May, 1915, watched prisoners
until October and was finally sent to the front, February, 1916,
where he fell sick.</p>

<p>“He was tired in his head.” “His commanding officer
made him drill without rhyme or reason; he would have been
able himself to have commanded with greater intelligence.”
He once attempted to put himself at the head of the company
to lead them against the Boche; this idea arrived to him all of
a sudden in a phase of perfect confidence and <i>sang froid</i>. He
thought his comrades would follow him and that the officers
would do likewise. He hoped thus to be able to end the war
one way or the other. He was getting tired of the war and
regretted his family life and kept saying that this was no
existence for family men. “We ought to attack or ask for
peace.” No one followed him and his comrades said he was
<i>un peu fou</i> but he did not share this opinion.</p>

<p>In point of fact he hardly knew how to read or write and
at home lived with his relatives, submitting himself entirely
to their guidance. He was much afraid of being punished and
often feared that he had done badly as he had <i>trop de conscience</i>.
He was non-alcoholic and without hereditary or
acquired neuropathic taint. He had no pronounced stigmata
of degeneration. He was rather reticent about certain
mystical ideas of a political tinge. At Villejuif, whither he
was brought February 17, 1916, he received a diagnosis of

<h4><b>Case 43.</b> (<span class="smcap">Briand</span>, February, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A soldier in the Territorial Army, 40, appeared before
the examining board in a depressed, dejected-looking state,
speaking slowly but collectedly and lucidly. Mobilized the
second day, this man was much afraid that he could not
get through the marches, and asked for a special examination
to determine whether his feet did not make him unsuitable
for fatigue. Two physicians thought he was unsuitable for
marching, and another thought he put it on. A trial march
was not executed well. He was kept in barracks but jumped
the wall, put on civilian clothes, and made off for Paris. But
a relative, warned by his wife, finally got him to go to the
authorities. He was told that he ought to return in the
afternoon, when suddenly he was arrested.</p>

<p>It seems that the man relied on the opinion of the two
physicians and discounted that of the third. He thought
himself the victim of an injustice, and not knowing how to
get on, it occurred to him that he would abandon the regiment
and get out of the difficulty. It was without resistance, however,
that he gave himself up as a prisoner. This fugue was
neither unconscious nor amnestic, nor was it due to an irresistible
impulse; nor can we say that it was due to a
genuine intellectual disorder. It was an emotional fugue, and
partly due to the man’s long-standing depression. It seems
that he had inherited this character from his father. He
was below normal intelligence, had a very poor education,
lost his wife, and grew more and more sombre. He married
again, but this time a neuropath. He began to be preoccupied
with his health and he had even some ideas of suicide.
At the time of his leaving the regiment, he had passed through
a phase of depression of about 6 months’ duration, and at
this time had a number of hypochondriacal ideas with poor
appetite and loss of weight.</p>

<p>Diagnostic dispute between regimental surgeon and

<h4><b>Case 44.</b> (<span class="smcap">Kastan</span>, January, 1916.)</h4>

<p>Julius Q. was sent on guard April 14, 1915, with orders
to remain there. While on guard he made a noise and made
a movement as if to take a knife from his pocket. Ordered
to empty his pockets, he attacked the other guards. The
witnesses said that he was drunk.</p>

<p>Upon examination, it appeared that he had recognized and
called by name those present in the guardhouse, despite his
supposed intoxication. There were red spots on the skin
and a certain amount of analgesia. His powers of computation
and reasoning were poor. He was unable to explain
the meaning of a picture shown him. He maintained that
he had an indomitable desire for drink. A diagnostic draught
of alcohol yielded no reaction. Upon dismissal, he got drunk
at once again, and had again to be imprisoned in a state of
excitement. What the outcome in this case was is not stated
by Kastan.</p>

<p>The previous history seems important. Julius Q. had been
a state ward. He had escaped several times from the institution
but had always to be brought back again because
he could not be trained at home. He had once attacked a
supervisor in the state institution with a knife. It seems
that he had at this time been drunk, having been brought
back drunk to the institution.</p>

<p>Two years before the war he had been taken to the Breslau
Hospital for the Insane on account of fits of insanity. In
1913 he had been a patient in Wuhlgarten on similar grounds.
The diagnosis there had been epileptoid degeneration, psychopathic
constitution, imbecility, or epilepsy(?). He had
been convicted of crimes a number of times and put to
labor. He had been given to cruelty in childhood.</p>

<p>Despite this, he was <i>declared perfectly healthy in mind and
body by the regimental surgeon</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1914, Q. fell suddenly ill in prison (he was presumably
in prison for a military offence), and smeared the cell with
feces, saying that he was able to do that as he could pay for
anything. He stared at the floor and failed to answer questions.
He remarked, however, that he had frequently been
convicted for breach of the peace and assault and battery,
and he said his father had been a drunkard, and he acknowledged
hallucinations to the extent of saying that he heard his
name called when he was alone.</p>

<p>The story of this case warrants our inquiring why such a
patient was kept in the army. He was kept there clearly
on account of the report of the regimental surgeon, who
could not have taken seriously the previous history of the
case, or else thought the patient perfectly good cannon fodder.</p>

<p>The hypothesis of syphilis apparently need not be entertained.
That of feeblemindedness is possibly the fundamental
diagnosis, yet epilepsy was considered by the German
diagnosticians, doubtless on account of the sudden violent
attacks and breaches of peace on the part of the patient.
There is clearly something behind mere alcoholism in the entire
story of this state ward. On the whole, the periodicity
of the attacks is equally consistent with the picture presented
by numerous feeble-minded persons, and the institutions that
had to deal with Q. regarded him rather as epileptoid.
There seems to be evidence of actual intellectual defect.
Accordingly it seems wiser to consider the case of Julius Q.
one of feeblemindedness, possibly of the moron group. We
should then consider the epileptoid features as part and
parcel of the feeblemindedness. We should consider the
intellectual defect a part of the process; and the uncontrollable
impulse to drink, the sudden violent attacks, and the cruelty
in childhood would then be regarded as merely symptomatic
of the feeblemindedness. It seems clear that either mental
tests by the regimental surgeon or an examination of the
patient’s previous history would tend to exclude such a
patient from the army.</p>

<p>How can a rifleman be an imbecile?</p>

<h4><b>Case 45.</b> (<span class="smcap">Kastan</span>, January, 1916.)</h4>

<p>Anton K. was down in the list as “missing.” He was
found at home. He said his feet had become sore from the
marching. He had lain down and become unconscious.
Coming to his senses, he was possessed only of trousers and a
shirt but he got a civilian suit in a village. He had gone home
part way by train, part way on foot. It seems that he did
not tell his father any details about his coming back although
he expressly denied deserting.</p>

<p>It seems no mental weakness had been noticed in the army.
It had been observed, however, that after seeing the first
corpses he was deeply impressed and did not want to see any
more. On examination in the hospital he gave the impression
of indifference and low spirits. He had to be urged to eat
and work. No great amount of intelligence defect could be
determined, though his knowledge and capacity were below
the average. The physician examining him thought his depression
was either caused by or increased by his imprisonment;
but this examiner thought that the protection of
Section 51 did not extend to the patient at the time of his
desertion. The examiner thought that an examination by a
psychiatrist was not necessary, though both judge and
prosecutor urged it.</p>

<p>When examined in the clinic, he seemed to be disoriented
for time. He claimed to have been able to stand the shooting
and the sight of the corpses. After becoming unconscious,
he had wakened and eaten cucumbers and carrots in the
fields, wandering on for a period of three or four weeks,
until he came to a place where he had formerly worked.
The reason he had thrown away his uniform was because
Russians had been about. He had not known that it was his
duty to report to the army again.</p>

<p>It was found that the patient’s father was poorly developed
as to mind, that his brother was subject to periodic mental
disturbance so that he had to be watched. It was found
also that K. himself had had a similar mental disturbance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
lasting a week, two years before. Moreover he was not
considered mentally right in his home town. In fact, no
one there wondered really at his desertion because he was so
stupid. His school work had been poor and limited.</p>

<p>He himself said that his people were of sound mind; that
during school days he had felt bad in his head, once running
into the woods after being told something. He was able
to give the names of his former superiors. His calculations
were only partly correct. He was poor at reasoning and at
simple distinctions; for example, asked the difference between
a bird and a butterfly, he replied that a butterfly was a bird
too. He did not know the difference between a river and a
lake. He thought Russia, England, and Austria were the
enemies of Germany.</p>

<p>He sat about or lay on the floor, motionless and indifferent,
with a newspaper stuffed into his trousers, unoccupied although
saying that he wanted to work, and even allowing
his fingers to be burned by cigarettes he was smoking.</p>

<p>He was tried once more and the first medical expert still
adhered to his former opinion, pointing out that K. was a
rifleman and that <i>only an intelligent man could be a rifleman</i>.
The court, however, accepted Kastan’s opinion and granted
K. the protection of Section 51.</p>

<p>In comment upon this case, it seems clear that ever so
slight a knowledge of K’s home town reputation would have
naturally excluded him from the army. However, what is to
be said “when doctors disagree,” as noted by Kastan in this
very case? It seems impossible, also, that his comrades
should not have noticed something odd about him (over and
above the deep impression on seeing the first dead) which
might have given occasion to the regimental surgeon for a
special mental examination. However, to the military mind,
mayhap the man seemed to be sufficiently “effective.”</p>

<p><i>Re</i> imbecility in a rifleman, the compiler has studied somewhat
elaborately the brain of a feeble-minded murderer with
some North American Indian blood in him. This man was
a crack shot despite his subnormality. It would seem that
the German regimental surgeons castigated by Kastan as
above were very properly so castigated.</p>

<h4><b>Case 46.</b> (<span class="smcap">Haury</span>, August, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A brusque little man, of a somewhat bold and talkative
disposition, though giving a good first impression, was evidently
a bit feebleminded, though (as Haury says) of the active
group. He had a sister like himself, whose children were
taken care of by the State, and at home he had had a number
of fugues, about which details were lacking. It was soon
evident what sort of soldier he would make, and he was put
in one of the Territorial regiments, but it was not noted that
he had a genuine mental disorder, as he was thought to be
just a peculiar person.</p>

<p>His new relations caused him to do a number of eccentric
things. He shortly proved to be in a sort of rudimentary
maniacal state; talkative, restless, scheming rather feebly to
go back to his village. He said that he couldn’t walk on
account of corns, and that these corns required a certain drug,
which he wanted to get from home. He said that he had
been struck by lightning twice; that he had fires in his body,
etc. He wanted only to be retired on a pension of one or
two hundred francs so he could take care of his farm, his hay
and his fields. There was no need of trying to get land by
means of bullets, he said, since he had enough.</p>

<p>The mental disorder of this man was much deeper than
appeared, and in fact, he did a number of dangerous things
compromising the security of the entire regiment.</p>

<p>Insubordinate desire to remain at the front.</p>

<h4><b>Case 47.</b> (<span class="smcap">Kastan</span>, January, 1916.)</h4>

<p>Friedrich L., on March 4, 1915, was ordered to go back to
the baggage-train. He did not obey. He said to the non-commissioned
officer who then came to him, “I am not
going; you have nothing to say anyhow, you ox-tender!”
He stood with his hands in his pockets, and, when the officer
seized him angrily by the collar, L. struck the officer’s face.</p>

<p>He stated at his hearing that no one had the right to send
him back. At that time even he conveyed the impression of
being not quite normal and was let off with his arrest only.
Later he refused again to go on guard duty, saying, “You
have nothing to say at all. Perhaps you will find out that
we shall meet each other again in hell tomorrow morning.”
He was taken before the physician, who considered him
mentally inferior and not entirely appreciative of the nature
of his acts. He was told that the death penalty would meet
such behavior, whereupon he remarked, “I am not afraid of
the death penalty,” staring excitedly at the officer and trembling
throughout his body. It seems that he had already
made an impression of mental inferiority in the troop, and
had once before said to an officer who wanted to send him to
the front, that he would not go; this had been regarded as
almost a breach of discipline. He had been in the habit of
not reacting to the calls of his superiors, and had smiled at
their reproaches. He seemed to hold the opinion that not
even a company commander had power to order him to go
back. Examined in the clinic he held to the same opinion,
that there was no need of his going back; that they took
volunteers; and that he wanted to remain at the front. On
the day of the deed, he had drunk a rye whiskey. He had
shaken off the non-commissioned officer because the leader
had seized him by the throat. In the clinic he often smiled
and wrinkled his forehead. He gave evasive and inadequate
answers. Asked about oaths and perjury, he remarked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
“I prefer to remain silent.”</p>

<p>He said that one of his sisters was a little stupid. Study
of his previous history indicates that Friedrich L. had formerly
been a quiet and steady man, although he often had
attacks of rage, breaking out upon sudden excitements. As
to his capacity in school, nothing could be learned, since the
Russians had taken the school registers away.</p>

<p>The analysis of this case seems to reduce to the question
of feeblemindedness and schizophrenia, unless some form of
inborn qualitative inferiority of mind be preferred as the
diagnosis. On the whole, possibly, the diagnosis of feeblemindedness
seems preferable. The entire symptom picture
seems to relate to the patient’s one mental attitude about
sticking at the front, <i>ruat coelum</i>.</p>

<h4><b>Case 48.</b> (<span class="smcap">Lautier</span>, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A man with the extraordinary first name of <i>Agapithe</i>
(Laurent insists on the frequency of strange first names in
degenerate families) came from Val-de-Grâce to Villejuif
June 5, 1916, with the diagnosis of mental weakness, interpretative
ideas of persecution, mental excitement, recrimination,
logorrhoea, and a tendency to revengeful reactions.</p>

<p>On arrival the patient said he must be in an insane asylum
because he heard <i>spiritiques</i> talking together. He, however,
was “not insane” and began expounding his plans for revenge
with the words “Kill,” “Cut-throat.”</p>

<p>This man had been placed in the auxiliary service by the
Council, called to the colors December 13, 1914, and finally
sent to the front in May, 1915. In July he was made prisoner
in a brush. He said, “I cried out, ‘Comrades, what
difference does it make to me whether I am German or
French? My officers are imbeciles that drink the blood of us
unlucky ones!’” He was interned in some camp whose
name he could not exactly give and reported that the Germans
were very gentle with him, that his real enemies were
the French, for the French were against him night and day.
“As a matter of fact, among Germans the French are nothing
but <i>cochons malades</i>. The Germans are fine types.”</p>

<p>He was repatriated in May, 1916. He kept making verbose
and neologistic eulogia of the Germans. He had been
a farm boy in Brittany, where he had had headaches. He
had been at Quimper Asylum in 1910. In fact, he said his
parents had tried to poison him and to have him assassinated;
they had charged him with setting fire to their house. His
mother was an imbecile, he said, who believed she was the
Queen of France. His recriminations did not stop short of
himself. He had been accused of kissing a girl and stealing
apples; as a matter of fact he knew what to do with girls.</p>

<p>He had a coarse face and a number of stigmata besides his
name <i>Agapithe</i>. He was kept at Villejuif as an imbecile.</p>

<p>Unfit for service: Question of feeblemindedness.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 49.</b> (<span class="smcap">Kastan</span>, January, 1916.)</h4>

<p>Walter N. was declared unfit for military service in 1912,
on the ground of mental incapacity. He had shown this
clearly during his period of training. He committed a number
of slight offences secretly, but not so secretly but that
they were immediately discovered and punishment meted
out therefor. He could do nothing without aid. It appears
that his mental weakness had not been noticed in school, but
that his employers had thought him both feebleminded and
irresponsible. Nevertheless he always executed orders properly.
While in hospital in 1912, he had occupied himself
very little, sitting indifferently, quiet and dreaming. At that
time, he had shown poor calculating ability and decreased
power of perception. It also appears that he did not grasp
the nature of simple orders, the requisite associations being
disturbed.</p>

<p>Despite this history, on September 11, 1914, he found himself
being transported. He claimed to be very tired. Upon
reaching the city, he picked up a large stone and raised his
arm as if to strike the transport leader. While N. was being
bound by the transport leader in consequence, he kicked at
his leader’s shins.</p>

<p>In the clinic he resisted examination, moving his legs
without speaking, staring at the floor, moaning frequently,
sitting motionless with head hanging, answering monotonously
repeated questions, but turning his head at a loud
noise. He felt ill. It appeared that he was oriented and
that his knowledge was well preserved although his calculation
ability was poor.</p>

<p>It would seem that psychiatric examination, possibly with
the aid of psychological work, would have excluded Walter
N. from the army.</p>

<h4><b>Case 50.</b> (<span class="smcap">Soukhanoff</span>, November, 1915.)</h4>

<p>An Esthonian, 21, a soldier in a reserve regiment, came to
a psychiatric section towards the close of 1914. He was
negativistic, mumbling, restless, fugacious; later more tranquil.
One day he entered the physician’s office, walking up
and down, mute, looking at articles and attempting to take
them away.</p>

<p>February 21, 1915, he was evacuated to the Notre Dame
Hospital for the insane at Petrograd,&mdash;a tall, healthy,
agitated-looking youth with a rapid pulse. He explained in
poor Russian how he was now among Germans and feared
that they were going to hurt him. At first in the hospital
he was seclusive and morose. March 9 he became excited,
and tried to break through the door. He was placed in the
bath, agitated and yelling. An Esthonian interpreter did
not quiet him. The Germans were going to make a martyr
of him. After an hour of this he grew quieter, and next day
complained only of head weakness and malaise, was in good
humour, smiling, and reading an Esthonian paper, and well
behaved in church, though tired and pale.</p>

<p>He now got better, began to work and wrote letters. It
seemed as if he had waked up from a painful dream. He
explained how he thought he had been in captivity; that
he was going to be hanged. He had thought that the Germans
could talk Russian. He had had hard work in his
regiment, as he did not understand Russian and had never
before left his little village in Livonia. His mental disorder
had started in the autumn, but all that was now like a dream.
He said that he had had a mental disorder of short duration
following some bodily disease, at the age of thirteen. According
to Soukhanoff, this is a case of Meynert’s amentia,
in a somewhat feebleminded person. The twilight state
might well receive (according to Soukhanoff) the term “oniric
delirium” invented by Régis.</p>

<p>A soldier, 39, a herdsman, was shell-shocked at Hill 304
May 23, 1916, buried twice, slightly wounded in right eye,
and carried unconscious to Bar-le-Duc. He was then forty
days in a semi-confusional state with headaches and dreams

came in the waking state, in which state he could recognize
them as imaginary. In April, 1917, he said he had always
been afraid, even in daytime, that he would be hurt and had
been especially troubled by the fear of shells. He was also
bothered by nocturnal enuresis which might become an incurable
disease and bring impairment of memory and attention.
Although not feebleminded the man was of but moderate
intelligence, and his emotions, according to Duprat,
were such as to defeat any complete resolution of his plight
by the intellect.</p>

<h4><b>Case 52.</b> (<span class="smcap">Pactet</span> and <span class="smcap">Bonhomme</span>, July, 1917.)</h4>

<p>An infantryman, Class of 1913, at the front from September,
1914, had a somewhat infantile build physically but
was intellectually of average powers, having been a type-setter
(three years in a job). However, the confined life had
borne hard upon him and his father put him on a farm. He
passed through his military service successfully, though he
was given two weeks in the guardhouse for overstaying
Easter leave. He was suggestible enough at this time to
think that he would not be punished very severely, since
there were other men whose leaves did not expire at the same
time as his own.</p>

<p>He was buried twice in the same morning, March, 1915,
at Bois Le Prêtre, spent four or five days in hospital, and
went back to his battalion. But now there was a change in
his character. Formerly indifferent to danger, he was now
apprehensive every time he went to the line and felt an
almost irresistible impulse to make for the rear. He was
condemned to five years in prison, June, 1915, but was
finally sent back to the front.</p>

<p>However, in July he left his company a second time as it
was going into the trenches, and this time the captain simply
asked him to do better. A third fugue, a few weeks later,
sent him back to court-martial, and thence to be examined by
alienists. He was perfectly conscious at the time of the fugues
and understood his duties and possible punishments. All he
would say was, “<i>It is stronger than I am.</i>” Fear outweighed
every consideration after the episode of the shell burials.</p>

<p>The man may be regarded as a hypobulic, somewhat feebleminded
person, able to get on in civil life but thrown out of
gear by war. Of course, the concept of fear as a disease can
easily be overdone; however, here was a case in which three
desertions occurred; the third after severe punishment. In
the differential diagnosis, epilepsy, alcoholism, impulsive
poriomania, must be considered, as well as feeblemindedness.</p>

<h4><b>Case 53.</b> (<span class="smcap">Hewat</span>, March, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A Scotch soldier, in the Royal Navy, 43, was admitted to
the Royal Victoria Hospital at Netley, as major epilepsy.
He had been 12 years a stoker, and 16 years before admission
had suffered from syphilis, a chancre locally treated with
black wash, without secondary rash.</p>

<p>After leaving the Navy, he had worked in a fire-brigade
and as dock laborer. He had been very alcoholic when funds
permitted, although never “primed.” His first convulsive
seizures came at 40, while working at the docks, following a
night on which he had drunk a bottle of whiskey. He
thought he had been about half an hour in the fit.</p>

<p>He joined the A. S. C., January, 1915; served in France;
later at Salonica. He had eight convulsive seizures, some
in France, and others at Salonica, always after much rum.</p>

<p>The man was tall, powerfully built, without visceral disease,
speech defect, or other symptoms except that both
pupils showed the typical Argyll-Robertson phenomenon.
The deep reflexes of arms and lower legs were increased.
The superficial reflexes were diminished, and the Wassermann
reaction strongly positive. A seizure was observed
by Hewat and the diagnosis of major epilepsy was revised.
The diagnosis of cerebrospinal syphilis, non-paretic, was preferred
to that of paresis on account of the absence of all the
ordinary symptoms of paresis and of tremor. It might be
asked whether these fits were chiefly alcoholic in origin.
However, the patient had two or three fits while in hospital
during a period of eight teetotal weeks. Hewat remarks
that the case suggests that the serum of any patient developing
epileptiform seizures for the first time say between 35
and 50 years of age, should be given the Wassermann test.</p>

<h4><b>Case 54.</b> (<span class="smcap">Bonhoeffer</span>, July, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A man of 35 in the <i>Landwehr</i> acquired syphilis some time
in the summer of 1914. He was a good soldier, passed
through several clashes, and was promoted to <i>Unteroffizier</i>.</p>

<p>To understand what followed it must be stated that he had
been a bed-wetter to 11, had been practically a teetotaler
(Bonhoeffer’s point is perhaps that otherwise epilepsy might
have developed sooner?), and, when he did drink, vomited
almost at once, and had amnesia for the period of drunkenness.
His father drank. His sister had fits as a child.</p>

<p>February, 1915, the <i>Unteroffizier</i> lost appetite, got headaches,
and went to hospital for a time. Upon getting better,
he was sent on service to Berlin. In a Berlin hotel he had
his first convulsions and unconsciousness, biting his tongue.
He was confused for several days, and, when he had become
clear, had a pronounced retrograde amnesia together with a
tendency to fabricate a filling of events for the lost period.</p>

<p>This retrograde amnesia is uncommon in epilepsy and
suggests organic disease. No sign of such was found, or
signs of the epileptic make-up. The serum W. R. was
negative. On the whole, Bonhoeffer regards the epilepsy as
“reactive” to the syphilis, as a syphilogenic epilepsy.</p>

<p>Alcoholism caused amnesia in this man in the same way as
the syphilitic epilepsy now did.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> epilepsy and syphilis, Bonhoeffer states that he has
repeatedly seen syphilis giving no other symptoms than epilepsy
develop in the campaign. At the same time, Bonhoeffer
does not find that the incubation period in paresis
can be shortened by war factors; at all events, by the exhaustion
factor in war (see <a href="#case25">Case 25</a>). It might be questioned
whether the above case (<a href="#case54">54</a>) was not psychogenic; that is,
whether the syphilis did not act in combination with being
sent to Berlin on service as a psychic factor. However, this
epilepsy on the whole seemed not psychogenic.</p>

<h4><b>Case 55.</b> (<span class="smcap">Bonhoeffer</span>, July, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A soldier in the reserves, 23, was, subsequently to his
being brought to hospital, described by his wife as a rather
over-sensitive fellow, who could hardly look at blood and
was meticulous about the household. He had always been
subject to headaches, especially after hard work. However,
he had passed through his military training well in
1910, not even having been <i>bestraft</i>.</p>

<p>He began service in October and fought at Dixmude on
the 19th. On the 24th in the trench and while being carried
back, he had several spells of pallor, falling stiff, and then
having convulsions. Brought finally to the Charité in Berlin,
he had more spells of sudden pallor, collapse with brief convulsions,
tossings in bed, as well as absences, post-convulsive
headaches, and mild bad humor.</p>

<p>There were numerous attacks several days apart in the
first seven weeks. The patient was not of an “epileptic”
disposition, though readily dissatisfied and headachey.</p>

<p>The serum W. R. was positive. Treatment by mercurial
inunctions. No further convulsions. Prognosis doubtful.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> epilepsy and the war, during the first six months
Bonhoeffer observed 33 cases in the Charité Clinic in
Berlin. Twenty of these 33 cases, unlike <a href="#case55">Case 55</a>, had
attacks before the war, although ten of these had become
epileptic rather late, namely, after the period of active military
service, at ages from 22 to 27. The development of
epilepsy like <a href="#case55">Case 55</a>’s is not without frequent precedent.</p>

<p>Bonhoeffer states that aside from epilepsy directly due to
brain injury by shells, there has been no certain case in which
we have the right to regard the war itself as the total cause
of the epilepsy. Some, like <a href="#case55">Case 55</a>, are of syphilitic origin.
No subject with a severe long-standing epilepsy has been
able to get into the field, according to Bonhoeffer; when
they do, they prove constitutional subjects.</p>

<p>An epileptic imbecile, court-martialed.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 56.</b> (<span class="smcap">Lautier</span>, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A Belgian soldier was condemned by court-martial February
27, 1915, to five years imprisonment for leaving his
post in the presence of the enemy. It seems that he was
mounting guard with two of his comrades and all three left
to eat as no food had been brought to them.</p>

<p>A physician examined the Belgian soldier and declared
him responsible, although a little sick. All three were condemned
to imprisonment. The Belgian attracted attention
in prison through crises of anxiety and agitation; he had
terrible nightmares, seeing Germans in his cell and hearing
gunshots. He was accordingly sent to a special infirmary
of the dépôt, whence July 24 to Sainte-Anne, July 26 to
Villejuif. He talked Flemish, hardly understanding French,
and spoke slowly and with difficulty. He hardly knew how
to read or write. He had been a truckman.</p>

<p>At 18, this soldier, according to his own account, began to
have nervous crises in which he fell, lost consciousness, bit
his tongue, foamed at the mouth and urinated involuntarily.
The attacks were somewhat rare. His father sent him in
1910 to Gheel where he stayed two years. Returning home
he helped his father in the trucking work.</p>

<p>When the Germans came the family fled to France and,
about the end of 1914, he was put into the military service
and sent to the front after a very short period of instruction.</p>

<p>The man had followed the example of his two comrades
without taking the slightest thought. He did not understand
the gravity of his act. He was not remorseful, regretful
or angry against his judges. He was well oriented
but quite indifferent. He was a tall, intelligent looking man
with adherent lobules, slight facial asymmetry and evidence
of tongue biting. He wrote like a child and read slowly,
spelling out the complicated words. He was employed at
various manual tasks during his sojourn at the asylum and
had no epileptic attack. He was given over to the Belgian
military authorities October 5, 1915.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="case57">
<p>Seizures in a feebleminded subject&mdash;psychogenic
components.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 57.</b> (<span class="smcap">Bonhoeffer</span>, July, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A 21-year old tailor, unused to marching, went into the
field in August. A month later, after a period of long standing,
he was nauseated and fell in a faint. Upon waking, his
fingers were stiff and he had pains in his legs. He got better
in the reserve hospital and was sent back to the line. On the
way he had a similar seizure, with nausea and fainting. On
the way back to Berlin, he had a seizure in the railway station,
and was carried to the Charité Clinic. At the clinic
he stated that he could feel an attack come on; that he first
had <i>Angst</i> all over his body, and that it was hot inside of his
head. Latterly he had been able to stop an attack by
clenching his teeth, after which the attack would not proceed
except that all became black before his eyes.</p>

<p>He was observed for four weeks but no seizure appeared.
He was somatically negative; his Wassermann reaction was
negative. There was nothing hysterical about his make-up;
he was somewhat surly and of low mental grade. He was
unwilling to walk alone for fear of attacks.</p>

<p>As to the heredity of this soldier nothing is known. He
had been an illegitimate child; he was a sleep-walker in childhood;
he had sometimes spoken out loudly in sleep as a boy.
At school he had been somewhat backward, fought readily
with his mates, and often complained of dizziness and headaches.
He could not stand smoking or drinking well, getting
drunk upon two glasses of beer. He had not held positions
well. He became a <i>pionier</i> in 1914, working chiefly as a
tailor.</p>

<p>Early in his time as a soldier he had obtained an ulcer
of the glans, which had been excised and burned. There
had been no secondary symptoms.</p>

<p>According to Bonhoeffer, this is an example of a not
infrequent condition. Although the attack itself and the
habitus of the patient did not look hysterical, the manner in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
which the attacks repeated themselves speaks for psychogenic
components. Just as genuine hysterical attacks may be
looked on as reactions to unpleasant situations, so may these
attacks. In fact, we are probably dealing with an hysterical
fixation of the symptoms of emotional fright like those in the
true hysterias following shell explosion. A great many of
the phenomena of Shell-shock, to use the English phrase, are
not in and of themselves of a psychogenic nature, but they
are, according to Bonhoeffer, psychogenically liberated under
the influence of unpleasant ideas.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> reactive epilepsies, Bonhoeffer considers that there is
a group of reactive epilepsies in which the war process plays
an important part. The prognosis of these cases ought to
be relatively favorable. In point of fact, <a href="#case57">Case 57</a>, although
a feebleminded subject, seems to have had a relatively favorable
prognosis: at all events, no new seizures appeared
under prolonged medical observation. These reactive seizures
may occur in cases with a labile vasomotor system.
They are, according to Bonhoeffer, aligned rather more
with hysteria than with genuine epilepsy. Genuine epilepsy
has not been developed in the war cases observed by Bonhoeffer
except where an endogenous factor was clearly in
evidence; or else where there was the requisite antebellum
soil for the development of an epilepsy. In short, genuine
epilepsies developing in the war are all, according to Bonhoeffer,
predispositional. The antebellum soil was clearly
in evidence in <a href="#case57">Case 57</a>. Even before the war, according to
Bonhoeffer, many German soldiers during the period of military
service gave evidence of their epileptic soil by sundry
suspicious phenomena. Among these were fainting spells
during hard drilling and other exercises, spells of enuresis,
abnormally deep sleep, and even phenomena of somnambulism.
One of the Bonhoeffer epileptics had been released
during his reservist practice as unfit for military service,
and had only been put into the line at his own urgent request
at the outbreak of the war. Three volunteers concealed
their epileptic history. One man, who had had merely petit
mal attacks before the war, regarded them as of little consequence,
entered the service, and developed epilepsy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter" id="case58">
<p>Responsibility of a drunken epileptic.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 58.</b> (<span class="smcap">Juquelier</span>, March, 1917.)</h4>

<p>The question of responsibility arose in the case of a soldier
who left his camp the morning of October 23, 1916, and went
to a neighboring place, where he drank, with four others,
two quarts of wine. At about three o’clock in the afternoon,
his captain met him on the street, lost, and looking drunk.
He told him that he would send him to the trenches in the
evening. The man lay down and went to sleep. At about
six o’clock, it was found that he could not put on his equipment
alone, and in fact threatened the other men with his
bayonet, and then went to sleep. He woke up and explained
that he had had one of his nervous crises. He remembered
the matter of the bayonet but had forgotten everything else
about the struggle.</p>

<p>This soldier was 29 years old, the son of an alcoholic, and
the ninth child of a mother who died shortly after her tenth
pregnancy. He had had measles and bronchitis as a child,
and in childhood had had bad dreams; at the age of ten he
had swooning spells. He became a quarryman and a habitual
drinker, subject to dyspepsia, nightmares, and nocturnal
cramps. There had never been any crises, however, up to
wartime.</p>

<p>January, 1916, when a shell burst near him, the first sharply-defined
epileptoid crisis came, and was followed by a number
of others, either on leave or on service, March 8, June 2, and
July 13. These attacks showed a sudden fall without warning,
loss of consciousness, convulsions, tongue biting, incontinence
of urine, a period of more or less coördinate agitation
at the time consciousness was reappearing, sometimes a
fugue, and often amnesia for the whole. He had a scar on
the left border of the tongue.</p>

<p>Should this epilepsy be regarded as entailing irresponsibility?
He left camp before the crisis, accordingly in a
period when he was in full possession of consciousness and
will, and he had gotten into an irregular situation by drunkenness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
before his epileptic crisis started in. His struggle
with his comrades, however, appears to be a portion of a
post-critical dazed state. The medicolegal decision, therefore,
was that he was guilty of leaving his command but not of
the other misdemeanor. Considering the general nature of
epilepsy, the responsibility of this man for the whole adventure
is rather slight. The Council, however, condemned
the man to five years of labor, without admitting that the
crisis following so soon the actual misdemeanor should argue
a diminution of responsibility.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> epilepsy in the army, Lépine notes the serious theoretical
and practical problems to which it gives rise. In
the first place, epilepsy occurs in the army more frequently
than in the same number of men in civilian life. Consequently,
the diagnosis as to the really epileptic nature of the
attacks observed is not too easy. Again, the situation affords
much opportunity for simulation (see, for example, the case
of sham fits (<a href="#case78">Case 78</a>, Hurst), and the case of epileptoid attacks
controllable by the will (<a href="#case79">Case 79</a> of Russell)). Wounds
may produce it, and even wounds which do not affect the
brain; besides which, a variety of war conditions, short of
trauma, may produce it. When the ordinary impulsiveness
of the epileptic turns into automatism and to epileptic equivalents
(<i>états seconds</i>), much of medicolegal interest may
happen. <a href="#case58">Case 58</a> was just short of a murderer. Cases of
actual murder in epileptic equivalents have been known under
military conditions. Fugues with amnesia for the phenomena
(which look to the military man like intentional desertions)
form another group of epileptic events; but aside from the
manias and the fugues, there are still more dubious epileptoid
phenomena of a delusional and confusional nature, such
that the proof of epilepsy comes only afterward, when frank
convulsions supervene. <i>Re</i> fugues and desertion (the most
frequent of military delinquencies according to Régis), we
may think of the fugue reaction, according to Lépine, as a
natural reaction on the part of both the true delinquent and
the mentally sick subject. The loss of liberty, alcohol,
fatigue, minor phenomena of <i>commotio cerebri</i>, may lead to
states of mental depression that favor the fugue. It is an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
affair of the greatest delicacy for the expert to build up
again the exact plight of the soldier at the time of his desertion.
Special inquiry must be made of the man’s mates.
Only in this way can the wheat be separated from the chaff
and punishment allotted to those only who deserve it.</p>

<p>According to Lépine, there are fewer guilty fugitives than
there are innocent ones, or at least partially innocent ones.
In the decision, one takes account of the duration, the course,
and the peculiarities in the termination of the suspicious
flight. According to the military code, there are cases like
<a href="#case58">Case 58</a> in which the fugue itself was carried out in an unconscious
state, and yet in which the martial responsibility
of the man was absolute. Drunkenness is no excuse for the
fugue, even if the latter is automatically carried out. Of
course, the paretic is not responsible for his fugue any more
than the organic dement, the delirious uremic, or the chronic
alcoholic, who is already severely demented. For a case of
this sort, see <a href="#case1">Case 1</a> (Briand).</p>

<p>In the differential diagnosis, we must also consider that
fugues may be carried out in confused states as well as at
times in various paranoid states, and even in melancholia.</p>

<p>A disciplinary case: Epilepsy.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 59.</b> (<span class="smcap">Pellacani</span>, March, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A Milanese workman, 28, was exposed to the sun on sentry-go
and had an attack of convulsions, on awaking from
which he found himself in hospital. He always had attacks
in reaction to emotion. One day, in a quarrel provoked by
jealousy concerning a prostitute, he apparently lost his mind,
whipped out a hunting-knife, and wounded a comrade.
Thereafter he lay unconscious until the next day. The
court-martial decided that he was not fully responsible.</p>

<p>Eventually, he was sent from the front for having insulted
and struck a superior officer. The report read also that he
was a prey to delirium and had frothed at the mouth. In
the interior he had convulsive attacks, with falling and loss
of consciousness. He told of arguing with a sergeant about
a bicycle, of seeing darkness before his eyes like a veil, and of
subsequent amnesia. In hospital he had intense headaches
at times, with spells of sullenness, hostility, and complaints
concerning nurses and attendants and other patients. At
other times, he was quiet and comfortable. One day he
went into an excitement and wept, asking to be sent back to
the army, striking the table with his fist and head. He then
screamed, flew into a passion, and fell to the ground in semi-stupor,
shaking his body and trying to kick and knock away
those who intervened. He was placed in bed but remained
agitated and unconscious, with anesthesia and frothing at the
mouth. The abdominal and cremaster reflexes were absent
in this attack, and the pupils were rigid and myotic. The
pulse was rapid and the blood pressure high. Afterwards
he was sleepy, stupid and weary, and showed fine rapid
tremors of hands, tongue, and eyelids. The abdominal reflexes
now returned in excess, and a marked dermatographia
developed.</p>

<p>Upon investigation, it was found that the patient’s father
was also an epileptic and was alcoholic; that one paternal
uncle had died in an asylum; another of apoplexy; that two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
maternal uncles were chronic alcoholics (one in an institution);
that an alcoholic brother had been six times convicted
of assault and battery; that a sister had howling, crying, and
hair-pulling spells, throwing herself to the ground. The
patient himself had had an early Bright’s disease and had
always been an undisciplined, excitable, and impulsive boy,
sometimes kept out of school. His first conviction was at
18, for assaulting a policeman, and he had been arrested
four further times for assault and battery. He stated that
his convulsive attacks with the veil before the eyes came on
when he was irritated or had taken cold, or had drunk to
excess, or had over-exerted himself. He said he suffered
from intense headache, weariness, and sleepiness after an
attack. He always bit his tongue at the same period. Irritation
and exertion sometimes caused attacks of dizziness and
vertigo without unconsciousness. Alcoholism; ulcer in an
inguinal gland. He had been confined in an asylum 40 days
for epilepsy, attacks of which had become more frequent
after he had heard of his father’s death.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> violence and epilepsy, Lépine remarks that a pure
epilepsy unclouded by alcoholism may occasionally give rise
to acts of extreme violence, but these pure epileptic violences
are infinitely rarer than the alcoholic ones. The Milanese
was in point of fact alcoholic, and in his ancestry were a
number of alcoholics as well as epileptics. According to
Lépine, when subjects are “out for blood,” they are almost
always either, like this Milanese, hereditary alcoholics, or
else strongly predisposed subjects, or even the offspring of
the insane.</p>

<p>A disciplinary case: Epileptic attacks with amnesia.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 60.</b> (<span class="smcap">Pellacani</span>, March, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A Veronese, 23, quarrelled with his comrades, and one day
wounded one. Another time, when reproved by a superior,
he struck him with a shoe; and at still another time, hurled
himself upon his superior officer and bore him to the ground.
Yet he seemed to have a perfect amnesia for all these violent
acts. At other times, he had convulsive attacks with a
mental state which seemed to combine anger and depression,
after which he would fall to the ground, lose consciousness,
go into clonic spasms, spit bloody saliva, and cause wounds
and abrasions upon his body. Once, after such an attack,
he passed into a brief excited spell. Finally he was so insubordinate
and violent to superior officers, that he was
brought under hospital observation, having been excited and
confused for a day.</p>

<p>Next day he was lucid, oriented, and tranquil; entirely
amnestic for what happened the day before, though his acts
were sufficiently unusual. He had threatened his superior
officer and been reproved and sent to prison to think it over.
In prison he had suddenly thrown himself against another
innocent person and clutched him tightly about the neck.
He threw another violently to the ground and then ran to
help the previous victim! Bound fast, he had succeeded in
freeing himself and thrown himself furiously against the prison
door, whereupon he had fallen to the ground in an epileptic
fit. He had tachycardia (120) and a generalized hypalgesia.
The vasomotor reactions were excessive.</p>

<p>Upon investigation it proved that his mother had been
subnormal and that the patient had been constitutionally
excitable and unstable, given to attacks of anger and impulsiveness
from youth up. In fact, he had been in prison
several times for violence. He described himself in his restless
spells as feeling a trembling all over his body as if his
blood were boiling in his heart and his head, whereupon he
would lose knowledge of what he was doing. He had been a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
quarrelsome boy, pursuing his mates with knives and stones.
Once, after arguing with a car conductor, he had broken the
car windows, turned everything upside-down, and thrown the
conductor into the street.</p>

<p><a href="#case60">Case 60</a> is clearly in the same group as <a href="#case59">Case 59</a>. The
Veronese falls into the same frame with the Milanese except
that he appears not to have been alcoholic. The insubordinations
of the Veronese were apparently carried out in
a state of unconsciousness. The majority of insubordinates
appear not to be epileptics. Some authors have called attention
to pathological politeness as an occasional symptom in
epilepsy. Perhaps the majority of insubordinate cases are
feebleminded or schizophrenic.</p>

<p>Desertion in epileptic fugue.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 61.</b> (<span class="smcap">Verger</span>, February, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A blacksmith from the Rochefort Arsenal, 27 (nothing
known as to grandparents; father, now in the fifties, for 30
years in an asylum with frequent attacks of furor; mother,
45, well and apparently well-balanced; brother with the
colors, wounded and decorated with the military medal; a
cousin-german, who has had a typical epilepsy&mdash;in the
patient himself enuresis up to 13 or 14, later, less frequently;
apparently no tongue-biting; no information as to infectious
diseases; graduate from primary school, apprenticed
to a blacksmith; an unskilful worker; never able to rise to
the level of a <i>frappeur</i>), in 1909 had passed the board of
review and been put in the sixth division of the line. Antebellum
there was a history that one night at supper, he had
slipped away from quarters and gone 30 kilometres, home.
His astonished mother sent him back to the military post by
railway.</p>

<p>Upon the night of May 26-27, 1915, this soldier found
himself in the position of a sentry, opposite the enemy. He
told his comrade that he had to go away for a time, leaned
his gun against a tree, disappeared, and did not return. It
was then one o’clock in the morning. At six o’clock, he was
found two kilometres away from the lines, in a village. He
was in front of a barn where his company had been quartered
before taking possession of the advanced posts.</p>

<p>He was brought up before the military authorities; but
upon stating that in civil life he had wandered off several
times without knowing where he was going, he was submitted
to neurological examination. There was available a letter
from his family physician relative to his antebellum military
service. It appeared that he had committed a number of
breaches of discipline, and that he was regarded by the physicians
as a <i>déséquilibré</i>. He had lived with his mother a very
quiet and good life; there was no history of sexual irregularity,
and no history of illness except a slight catarrhal
jaundice. He had frequently suffered from headaches; there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
had been slight attacks of vertigo of very brief duration. He
had never fallen in these fits. From his story it was elicited
that he had had absences; his comrades had noticed that he
sometimes stopped stock-still with vague eyes, then shortly
regained his wits and continued upon his task. Sometimes
he would not work without being able to explain why he
went away. He would go off for a period and, upon coming
to, discover that he had not eaten his meals. There were
never, however, any convulsive crises by day or night. He
sometimes felt sick, and although there was no medical
treatment, from time to time he took bromides upon his own
authority, saying he had been ordered to do so by his father.
Although habitually of a gentle demeanor, nevertheless he
was subject to excessive anger upon slight occasion.</p>

<p>During the mobilizing and first months of the war, both
in quarters and at the front, however, his conduct had been
that of a good soldier. Suddenly, about March or April,
1915, the nocturnal enuresis began to be frequent again,
occurring twice or three times a week; but the patient hid
this misfortune as far as possible from his comrades. The
captain thought he looked tired and depressed sometimes.
Upon the days following the nights with enuresis, there was
intense headache and marked moral and physical depression.
There was no proof of nocturnal convulsions, and it is very
problematical whether there was tongue-biting.</p>

<p>Another odd feature was that the patient, who had been
sober in civil life, had become intoxicated several times after
going into the army. Physically, he was of low stature, but
otherwise well built. Neurologically, he was entirely negative.
There was no sign of venereal disease. There were a
few stigmata of degeneration; for instance, there was very
little hair upon the face, the ears were unequal in size, and
the teeth were somewhat anomalously set. Mentally, he
was below par; for instance, he could not add mentally two
numbers of two digits.</p>

<p>As to his desertion, the patient says he does not know
what he did; that he learned of his act only from his comrades
in the morning; that he remembered having left his
duty <i>pour aller satisfaire un besoin</i>.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="case62">
<p>A specialist in escapes (epileptic fugues).</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 62.</b> (<span class="smcap">Logre</span>, March, 1917.)</h4>

<p>An epileptic fugue with recidivism is described by Logre.
He described himself as a specialist in escapes. As a schoolboy,
he had practised escapes and run away without purpose,
and without remembering fully what he had done. His
father would bring him back to school. At first they had
punished him and then would pardon him. These escapades
in his work as a shoemaker caused him to lose various places,
but he had been kept by one employer for a long time nevertheless.
From 11 years on, this patient had never ceased
living either in foreign parts or in prison.</p>

<p>The fugues on military service began to multiply. The
military chiefs did not abide the escapades like the schoolmaster
or the employer. Every punishment he received had
to do with some fugue. Three times he gave himself up to
the military authorities. Three times after a few more days’
service or a week in prison, he left the barracks or escaped.
There had never been any appeal throughout this history to
an alienist. On the declaration of war, he had returned to
Belgium and was put into the army; whereupon in January,
he carried out a fugue of a few hours which was rewarded
with eight days in prison. There was a five-days fugue in
July, whereupon he was taken before the council.</p>

<p>Upon investigation, these fugues seemed to have the
classical features of epileptic fugues. They were sudden,
unconscious, blindly automatic, almost completely forgotten
afterwards and of a stereotyped and recidivistic nature.
Most of the fugues had been preceded by a slight excess in
drinking. An investigation was made to see if there were
any convulsive antecedents; none were found. This mental
epilepsy, then, it was thought, must be an isolated symptom,
free from every motor symptom. But his mother and one
of his brothers had also shown a number of attacks of some
sort of epilepsy. In all three cases there was impulsivity,
unconsciousness, absurdity, recidivism, and refractoriness to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
treatment. On these grounds the fugue was regarded as
pathological and as epileptic probably. The patient himself
thought that these <i>coups-de-tête</i> and this mania for running
away without knowing where, made really a very ugly
fault, particularly in a soldier.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> such specialists in escapes as <a href="#case62">Case 62</a>, Lépine speaks
of a type of military delinquent which he calls <i>Ceux qui
sautent le mur</i>. Some of the fugue subjects, as well as other
types of imbalance can apparently be held by no possible
kind or degree of discipline. They jump any guardhouse
or any other form of imprisonment through what amounts
to a wild instinct for liberty. In some cases, this instinct
appears in a relatively pure form; that is, without any
combined tendency to dipsomania and without any sexual
factor. Some of them are, in fact, very good soldiers, especially
in shock troops. They, in fact, belong to what one
might call the good element among delinquents. In the
French Army some of them have been old legionaries and
have even been, as in <a href="#case62">Case 62</a>, previously condemned for
desertion. They form a curious minority among the wall
jumpers. Wall-jumping makes, so to say, the entire pathological
phenomenon, and the recidivism is a part of the
disease.</p>

<p>A disciplinary case: Epilepsy and other factors.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 63.</b> (<span class="smcap">Consiglio</span>, 1917.)</h4>

<p>An Italian private in the artillery (father dead of general
paresis) had been a victim of infantile convulsions and of
convulsions with loss of consciousness up to 18 (convulsions
with shouts and violence in the streets of Rome; had to be
put in a straight-jacket at the municipal hospital).</p>

<p>He developed more convulsions during antisyphilitic treatment
in the military hospital. He was a very poor soldier,
of the rough and violent sort, and after eight months of service
had to be assigned to a special disciplinary company,
with which he remained for fifteen months. Here also he
was punished frequently, and was given a period of four
months’ imprisonment for refusal to obey the officers. Then
for a period of several years he had no convulsions whatever.</p>

<p>During the war he was given to alcoholism, and one day in
June, 1916, he struck an officer and ran away to arm himself.
He was at this time observed by psychiatrists and declared
sane. He was regarded as an emotional and alcoholic epileptic
but not as neurotic or psychopathic. He was again
placed in a special disciplinary corps.</p>

<p>An epileptic goes through Mons and two years fighting
without symptoms. Then strange conduct with
amnesia.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 64.</b> (<span class="smcap">Hurst</span>, March, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A private, 26, epileptic from 11 to 18 (mother also epileptic)
entered the army at 20, attempted to commit suicide in
1912 (amnestic for this attempt), and went to France with
the expeditionary force in August, 1914. The retreat from
Mons and further fighting caused no recurrence of the symptoms.
September, 1916, he was in fact put in charge of
eight men doing guard duty. At this time he was able to get
to bed only every other night. The charge of the telephone
worried him, as he had never before been made to assume
responsibility. After two months of this, he was found one
night arresting civilians without cause and driving them before
him with fixed bayonet. He was let off court-martial on
the medical evidence, and at hospital remained confused and
suspicious. November 16, he was seen by a medical officer
in a typical attack of petit mal. Of all this, on reaching
England December 19, he had no recollection, and was keen
to return to duty.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> the remarkable delay in the return of epilepsy to this
soldier of Mons, Bonhoeffer remarks that one of the epileptics
observed by him at the Charité Clinic had passed
through nine battles, and another through 18 battles before
the first attack of epilepsy. Bonhoeffer regarded the strenuous
marching as a liberating factor of epilepsy in five cases,
actual fighting in seven cases, shell explosions in two cases,
and bullet wounds in three.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> the apparently psychogenic factor in Hurst’s case
(epilepsy coming on after assumption of too great responsibilities),
compare remarks of Bonhoeffer under <a href="#case57">Case 57</a> concerning
psychogenic factors. Sir George Savage has called
attention to a form of functional epilepsy following shock or
injury, in which recovery occurs after removal from the strain,
but in which there is a relapse if the men go back to duty.</p>

<p>Therapeutic (antityphoid inoculation) epilepsy.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 65.</b> (<span class="smcap">Bonhoeffer</span>, July, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A volunteer without psychopathic signs except a slight
stuttering, and without psychopathic history of any sort,
went into service at 17. After he had been a short time in
the field, a shell fragment injured him in the upper part of the
thigh. He lay up in hospital four weeks. He then spent
four weeks in the reserve.</p>

<p>He was then given antityphoid inoculation, and a half
hour afterward had epileptic convulsions. These appeared
four times more during the next fortnight, as a rule followed
by a delirious excitement. No fever was reported. After
the fourth attack, he was transferred to the Charité Clinic.</p>

<p>At the clinic there were no attacks, and there was nothing
epileptic to discern in the make-up of the patient. His
nervous system was normal to examination. There was,
however, one fact in the family history of note, namely,
that an older brother of the patient, 20 years of age, suffered
from convulsions.</p>

<p>What is the relation of the antityphoid inoculation to the
epilepsy? According to Bonhoeffer, we must not forget the
family history even if we regard the inoculation as the liberating
factor. Curiously enough, the shell injury did not
itself serve apparently to bring out the epilepsy. Bonhoeffer
has seen three other instances of epileptic attacks or epileptoid
phenomena following antityphoid inoculation. However,
in the hundreds of thousands of inoculations, it is not
to be wondered at perhaps that there should be a number
of instances of epileptic attacks. One was a man with
severe epileptic taint; in the others, there was a question of
pathological intoxication.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> antityphoid inoculations, a French observer&mdash;Paris&mdash;remarks
that these inoculations may occasionally start
up the symptoms of general paresis. Compare in this connection
also <a href="#case63">Case 63</a>, in which a syphilitic developed convulsions
during antisyphilitic treatment. The psychogenic
factor of intravenous injection itself, with its possible effect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
upon glands of internal secretion, can hardly be distinguished
from purely serological effects. Paris goes so far as to state
that he regards it as imprudent to vaccinate a syphilitic
subject. He thinks it might be better for a syphilitic subject
to contract typhoid or paratyphoid fever than to run
the risk of developing paresis. If the soldier happened to
be not only syphilitic but alcoholic, then the danger would
be larger. Possibly, however, both Bonhoeffer’s case of antityphoid
inoculation epilepsy and the cases alluded to by
Paris of antityphoid inoculation, are merely statistical
accidents.</p>

<p>Shell-shock; (apparently slight) scalp wound:
Jacksonian seizures. Operation, decompressing
the edematous upper Rolandic region. Recovery.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 66.</b> (<span class="smcap">Leriche</span>, September, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A Moroccan of the Seventh Tirailleurs was thrown to the
ground by the explosion very near him of a large calibre shell,
lost consciousness, and woke up with a slight contusion of
the right side of the head. The date of this injury is unknown.
He was evacuated to the interior, but stopped
May 25, 1915, at the evacuation hospital because his pulse
in the train stood at 51. An hour later in the hospital he
had a Jacksonian epileptic attack, followed by a left-sided
flaccid, brachial monoplegia, and after a quarter of an hour a
second crisis, and then a third,&mdash;a sort of epileptic status
occupying an hour. The attack seemed to start in the left
hand. After the crisis, hand and arm became flaccid and inert.</p>

<p>Lumbar puncture in the crisis gave fluid under small
tension in a few absolutely limpid drops. The wound was a
superficial skin wound as big as a 25-centime piece, near the
middle line, roughly corresponding with the upper Rolandic
region. It was hardly a wound&mdash;a mild abrasion not passing
the epidermis; periosteum and bone intact.</p>

<p>The patient was trephined and a thin layer of clot was found
over the dura mater. The clot was removed and a crucial
incision was made into the dura mater. The brain seemed a
little edematous, hemorrhagic and bruised. It soon began to
beat and was tamponed.</p>

<p>May 26, complete brachial monoplegia without seizure.</p>

<p>May 27, seizure at 2 in the afternoon, starting in left arm.</p>

<p>The wound was going well and from this time forward
no more seizures. May 28, a cast was made for the hand.</p>

<p>June 4, lumbar puncture yielded a clear liquid under the
pressure of 58. That evening an hour after the puncture,
the brachial monoplegia disappeared. The arm was still a
little weak June 5. June 8 the man was evacuated to the
auxiliary hospital at Laversine. June 18, complete recovery.</p>

<h4><b>Case 67.</b> (<span class="smcap">Clarke</span>, July, 1916.)</h4>

<p>Clarke had seen in the war but one case of hysterical
convulsions, though this particular patient had severe hystero-epileptic
fits occurring in series. The man had never suffered
from epilepsy and was 20 years of age. He received a slight
wound and fell back into the trench a distance of six feet,
striking but not contusing the back of his head.</p>

<p>On admission to the hospital he was found drowsy and dull.
Fits occurred a week later, following one another at brief
intervals in series that lasted one or two hours. The arms
would be raised and extended in clonic spasm; the patient
would resist violently if held, and then turn to his right side
with rigid extension of legs and back in opisthotonos. The
eyeballs underwent irregular movements, and there was a
well marked hippus. Though the tongue was protruded in
these attacks, it was never bitten. It was doubtful whether
there was a complete loss of consciousness. Between attacks,
the patient was morose and sullen, and showed a varying
incoördination of the movements of the left leg, which
was anesthetic to the knee. There was also a glove anesthesia
of the right forearm and hand. Fields of vision were
contracted.</p>

<p>The fits recurred with intervals of a day or two, for a
fortnight. The patient was then strictly isolated in a small
room with an observation window. His bed was made up
on the floor. He then had very slight attacks, as a rule when
the nurse came into the ward; no notice was taken of these
attacks and in a fortnight they ceased. The paresis of the
leg and the anesthesia also cleared up without treatment.
He remained in the general ward three weeks longer, at first
dull and listless, but later cheerful and active. Clarke
suggests that this patient was below normal intelligence.</p>

<p>Shell injury with unconsciousness; delayed attacks
of epilepsy: superposed hysterical hemihypesthesia.
Previous history consistent with the hypothesis
that a genuine epilepsy had been developed.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 68.</b> (<span class="smcap">Bonhoeffer</span>, July, 1915.)</h4>

<p>An excellent soldier, of good build, 29 years, a member of
the <i>Landwehr</i>, passed unscathed through eleven battles in the
1914 campaign, but finally succumbed to fragments of shell
which struck his chest and the lower part of his thigh. He
fell down, nauseated, and lost consciousness. He is said to
have struck about him with his arm and to have voided urine.
There was a second attack three weeks later, in which he
fell upon his face.</p>

<p>In the Charité Clinic he had three attacks, two of them
nocturnal, one in the daytime, followed by a long period of
somnolence. He once cried out suddenly in the night as if
warding off an attack. He complained of headaches, and was
often irritated and out of humor. Somatically, there was a
hemihypesthesia on the side of the injury.</p>

<p>The history indicates that this patient up to his sixteenth
year had been a victim of occasional enuresis, often cried out
in his sleep or even rose from bed. Occasionally he suffered
from such violent sudden headaches that he would have to
sit down. He was easily irritated, and had once been arrested
for assault. As a soldier, however, he had never been
guilty of any breach of discipline. Mild headaches would
follow drinking. These phenomena in the history pointed
in the direction of epilepsy. According to Bonhoeffer, we
cannot entirely exclude contusion of the brain from the shell
injury. However, there were no cerebral symptoms, and
the interval before the occurrence of the attacks rather indicates
that we are dealing with a genuine epilepsy. As for
the hemihypesthesia, this is a hysterical “<i>superposition</i>,”
which does not interfere, according to Bonhoeffer, with the
genuineness of the epilepsy.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="case69">
<p>Shell-wound; musculocutaneous neuritis: Brown-Séquard’s
epilepsy.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 69.</b> (<span class="smcap">Mairet</span> and <span class="smcap">Piéron</span>, January, 1916.)</h4>

<p>An infantryman, 30, a gardener, was wounded in the right
forearm by a shell fragment, which fractured the ulna, September
7, 1914, at Revercourt. Despite much fragmentation
of the bone and suppuration, the wound healed with two
cicatrices, where the fragments had gone in and had come
out. The scarring process was over in December.</p>

<p>However, in the middle of January, 1915, this man began to
suffer from headaches and insomnia, with vertigo and buzzing
in the head, “as if an airplane inside.” Sometimes arms
and legs would stiffen, and the man would tremble, have to
lie down, and even lose consciousness for a quarter of an hour,
waking up tired, wandering, and with feelings in his head.
These crises, at first occurring every week, later grew frequent.
Finally there was a very complete attack, in which
he fell out of bed, got up, made several turns about the room,
and went back to bed; and in the morning, was dull and disoriented.
Accordingly, he was sent to the central military
neuropsychiatric service of the general hospital at Montpellier,
November 10.</p>

<p>Besides the two extensive cicatrices, there were motor
disorders. Pronation and supination were almost impossible,
as well as extension of the hand and fingers and abduction of
the thumb. There was a radial paralysis without R. D.
Electrical excitability of the extensors was diminished on
the right. The hand was weak. The right thumb was
atrophic. There was a hypertrichosis as well as redness, heat
and perspiration of the right hand. There was a hypesthesia
for all forms of stimulation in the hand, especially in the
radial region; less in the ulnar region. This hypesthesia rose
along the posterior surface of the forearm and covered all
the territory of the ulnar nerve; but there was a corresponding
hyperesthesia in the musculocutaneous distribution, as
well as in the internal cutaneous distribution. Above the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
scar there was a region of complete anesthesia. The hyperesthesia
rose higher along the circumflex nerve and the posterior
branches of the cervical nerves and included the great occipital
distribution, even involving the superficial cervical plexus,
though not the territory of the trigemini. There was some
hyperesthesia of areas governed by a few dorsal intercostal
nerves. There were also spontaneous pains in these hyperalgesic
regions. The <i>musculocutaneous nerve</i> could be felt to
be <i>thick and swollen</i>, indicating a perineuritis. There were
no neuropathic stigmata, but the knee-jerks were exaggerated
a little more on the right side.</p>

<p>The convulsions appeared two or three times a day, the
pain would get worse along the arm, rise to the head, following
the hyperesthetic zone, then invade the interior of the
head, whereupon objects would appear to turn and the ears
would buzz. The right leg, and especially the right arm,
would begin to tremble. The man would have to support
himself to avoid falling. He saw shadows moving, colored
trees, occasionally persons. When the vertigo got stronger,
he lost consciousness. The extremities of the right side
stiffened and carried on jerky movements. These sometimes
extended to the left side. The seizure lasted from five
to fifteen minutes, and sometimes occurred in the middle of
the night. Fatigue followed but headache disappeared after
an attack.</p>

<p>The diagnosis of Brown-Séquard’s epilepsy was made. If
the musculocutaneous trunk was compressed, a crisis was
produced with pain radiating to the head, obscuration of
vision, numbness in the arm, and tremors. Electrical treatment
was resorted to for analgesic effect. There was a
certain improvement during May, so that the diurnal dizziness
disappeared. May 19 he had a period of 24 hours
without any vertigo. In June no further improvement
occurred.</p>

<p>An operation was performed June 23, 1915. The two
cicatrices were excised, and some fragments of cloth were
removed. Three Jacksonian crises followed the operation,
and there was another seizure next day. Frequent headaches
followed without crises. More seizures appeared in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the night during July, and their frequency increased. Pains
persisted along the arm and in the back of the head; the
musculocutaneous perineuritis was still intense. Prolonged
baths for the arm were begun August 4, two baths of two
hours each, at 40 deg. each day. Following August 10
there was an improvement, which stopped as soon as the
baths were omitted, with diminution of the vertigo and the
hyperesthesia. This improvement continued; the baths were
made to last three hours. There were no attacks from
August 21 to 26 whereupon they then returned for two days.
The pains had much diminished in the arm but persisted
in the occiput. A few night attacks occurred August 30
and 31, September 5 and 6, as well as September 19 and 20,
25 and 26, and 27.</p>

<p>The occipital pain had now become less; the musculocutaneous
nerve was not so large. Only a few headaches
followed during the months of October, November, and
December. After November 3 the baths were stopped and
the arm was kept wrapped in a warm compress. There was
still a certain hyperesthesia, the knee-jerks had become less
exaggerated. Massage and mechanotherapeutic exercises
were begun. There were no more attacks after September 27.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> Brown-Séquard’s epilepsy, Lépine remarks that besides
the case of Mairet and Piéron, Hurst and Souques have published
cases. Lépine himself has observed two cases: one
followed a nerve wound in the foot; another, a penetrating
wound of the chest. As a rule, such Brown-Séquard epilepsies
appear a number of months after trauma; as a result
of irritation in the scar. Lépine’s subjects were taken for
simulators because they had not received any <i>cranial</i> wound.
The prognosis should be guarded, though the outcome in
<a href="#case69">Case 69</a> appears to have been favorable.</p>

<p>Epileptic episode at 24 years following bullet-wound

childhood (sister epileptic). Reactive epilepsy? Epilepsia
tarda?</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 70.</b> (<span class="smcap">Bonhoeffer</span>, July, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A man in the reserve, 24, bore the stresses of the war very
well in the campaign in East Prussia until he was shot in the
hand at Deutsch-Eylau. He had always been well aside
from rheumatism, and was discharged with a good record
from his military service.</p>

<p>Sent to the reserve hospital for his hand injury, he had,
two or three times in the night, convulsions with loss of
consciousness and dilated pupils; after which there was a
thirty-six hour period of depression with refusal of food.
Thereafter this soldier had amnesia for both the seizures
and the subsequent depression. He was observed six weeks
longer in the Charité Clinic but had no more attacks, and
indeed nothing more of note either mentally or somatically.</p>

<p>The history showed that there had been convulsions in the
third and fourth years of the patient’s life. There had been,
however, nothing epileptoid in the later childhood or developmental
years of the patient. However, a sister of the patient
had suffered since childhood from convulsions. It remains
a question whether this episode is to be regarded as reactive
epilepsy&mdash;reactive, namely, to experiences in the war&mdash;or
whether we are dealing with a true epilepsia tarda.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> this episode following bullet wound, the compiler has
placed it after Mairet and Piéron’s case of Brown-Séquard
epilepsy, but apparently Bonhoeffer regards his case as probably
a reactive one. Unlike the case of Mairet and Piéron,
Bonhoeffer’s case had an epileptic soil (convulsions in childhood
and epileptic sister). <i>Re</i> the so-called reactive epilepsies,

</div>

<h4><b>Case 71.</b> (<span class="smcap">Bonhoeffer</span>, July, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A reserve lance-corporal, 24 years&mdash;a soldier from 1911
to 1913 without disciplinary record, and in his second year
becoming lance-corporal&mdash;was in the campaigns in Belgium,
East Prussia, and Poland, making long marches and going
through several battles. In the middle of October, 1914,
he fell from a horse and suffered a contusion of the thorax,
after which blood appeared in the sputum. In November he
was brought to the reserve hospital in Berlin, and there had
convulsive seizures. Before transfer to the Charité Clinic, a
seizure occurred, and he was brought into the clinic in a
characteristic dazed state. Thereafter he was clear but often
out of humor and irritated. Three weeks later came a brief
attack, probably epileptic in nature, with restless half-delirious
sleep following.</p>

<p>There was nothing in childhood or in the family history
to indicate epilepsy. However, the patient himself stated
that from 1913 onward, after his period of military service,
he had from time to time felt attacks of dizziness after
exertion, and that he had become more easily excitable than
before.</p>

<p>The attacks in the lance-corporal are probably not to be
attributed to the thoracic contusion, according to Bonhoeffer,
because of the long period that elapsed after the thoracic
injury, and their development nocturnally without special
occasion. According to Bonhoeffer, we are probably here
dealing with a late epilepsy.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> late epilepsy, see also under <a href="#case57">Case 57</a>. Bonhoeffer makes
a considerable point of the lateness in attacks of epilepsy in
some of the military cases, pointing out their beginning at
the ages of 22 to 27 in the period of peace practice undergone
by soldiers. The theory is that cases of severe and
long-standing epilepsy are known to the authorities, so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
they would not ordinarily be in military service except under
conditions of concealment or in case of error. The present
case (<a href="#case71">71</a>) appears to be the nearest that Bonhoeffer has
found to a case of epilepsy without heredity and without
acquired soil. All that can be regarded as evidence of soil
is the dizzy spells and excitability.</p>

</div>

<h4><b>Case 72.</b> (<span class="smcap">Hurst</span>, November, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A private, 27, is described as a typical martial misfit&mdash;in
private life a music hall falsetto singer, and afterward a
valet. He joined the army in 1915 and proceeded to France,
and worked in a canteen. A week later, men broke in and
threw a mallet at him, whereupon he immediately had a fit,
and was dazed, dumb, and unable to walk for two days.
Thereafter occasional further fits occurred, with nervousness
and insomnia. He was sent home in September, 1916.
Discharged to duty, he again in December returned to France,
had six fits in the first week&mdash;three in hospital, two on the
boat, and between two and four for four days after admission.
The diagnosis of genuine epilepsy was made in France by a
medical officer who had seen one of the convulsions. However,
he had never passed urine or bitten his tongue, had no
family history, and had never had fits before going to France.</p>

<p>He was hypnotized and given the suggestion that he would
have a fit. In the convulsion which followed the plantar reflexes
remained flexor, but otherwise the convulsion was
quite like the genuine epilepsy. He was told that he would
not have any more convulsions, nor did he have any more
except on Feb. 16, 1917, when some talk was made to him
about returning to duty. Bromides used in France did not
help the epilepsy at all. This patient developed a gait and
speech defect copied from two patients in the wards. These
symptoms, due to autosuggestion, disappeared on persuasion.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> autosuggestion, Bernheim has returned to the fray
(1917) in a book on automatism and suggestion, dealing only
in small part with war problems. The most general formula
for suggestion appears to be that it is an <i>idea accepted</i>. A
suggestion offered but not accepted is in effect not a suggestion
at all. Any accepted idea, says Bernheim, is from the
psychological point of view as well as from the medical point
of view, a suggestion. A suggestion may be direct or indirect,
reasonable or unreasonable, brought about by</p>

<p>A lieutenant without neuropathic tendencies (except that
his mother was in a hospital for the insane) was under shell
fire for some time. Finally, a shell burst near him, whereupon
headaches and transient spells of confusion followed. Shortly
upon the news of the death of his Major, he had a spell of
violent excitement and confusion, dancing about on the
ground and breaking things up. He passed into a stuporous
condition with a suggestion of catatonia. There were a few
isolated delusions to the effect that he was poisoned. After
sleeping a long time, he suddenly cleared up. There was an
extensive amnesia covering a period of weeks. He had forgotten
the Major’s death and everything thereafter. He
complained of headache, difficulty of thinking, and forgetfulness.
An agoraphobia developed, as well as great sensitivity
to sounds, and a feeling as if the bed and surrounding barracks
were moving. There were a few illusions of a visual nature.
He had complete insight into his condition. Conduct was
normal. There was general hyperesthesia and ageusia.</p>

spells. The true occasion of the convulsions appears to have
been the news of the death of a superior officer. It is, of
course, possible that the transient spells of confusion were
actually epileptic equivalents. Lépine remarks that Pierret
and others, observing such spells of confusion often accompanied
by agitation, have inquired whether manic depressive
psychosis is not a kind of epilepsy. This question remains
unresolved. These phenomena of epilepsia larvata (see also
<a href="#case81">Case 81</a> of Juquelier and Quellien) are to be sharply distinguished
from attacks of confusion occurring in pronounced
epileptics. These latter attacks often follow a crisis and
suggest exhaustion; sometimes they last several days.</p>

<p>Fatigue; fear; hysterical convulsions. Visual aura
(approaching fire wheel) built up after the third crisis
(scotoma after look at sun).</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 74.</b> (<span class="smcap">Laignel-Lavastine</span> and <span class="smcap">Fay</span>, July, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A sapper, 23, with his company under heavy bombardment,
October, 1916, was overcome by weariness and fear (he had
always been of a timorous disposition). The order for the
rear came, but the convoy was hardly en route when the
sapper felt a griping in the pit of the stomach and the blood
going to his head; whereupon he lost consciousness and went
into convulsions.</p>

<p>This incident seems to have made a powerful impression
upon the sapper. A fortnight later, while working in the
trenches, he had more epigastric sensations with vague discomfort.
He thought about the earlier crisis and about his
wounded comrades, and again fell down and had more convulsions
lasting a quarter of an hour. The tongue may have
been slightly bitten in this seizure. In the genesis of this
second seizure we may consider that the feeling of discomfort
and the epigastric sensations served to recall the first seizure,
so that the second one may be regarded as due to autosuggestion&mdash;that
is, as hysterical.</p>

<p>A little later, on a hot day in the trench, while working,
the sapper turned to a comrade and saw a great black spot
on his face. He turned toward another and saw another
great black spot on this face also. He was frightened, felt
strange sensations, fell, and had a third convulsive crisis.
The black spots that he saw were due to a scotoma, the
result of a transient glance at the sun.</p>

<p>After this scotomatous episode, his crises always had a
visual aura. He would feel rather uncomfortable, leave the
supper table, feel a gastric sensation, warmth in the face, and
oppression. He would go out in the cold for the air, look
about for something, appear frightened, fix his gaze upon a
certain point, and cease to reply to questions. His head
would jerk back suddenly, and he would utter strangled cries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
of fear. He was now evidently prey to a terrifying hallucination.
In ten minutes, everything had gone again, leaving
him trembling with emotion. He would then relate how,
after the epigastric sensation had begun, he tried to see if he
could make out something abnormal; whereupon a little
fiery wheel would appear and roll up nearer and nearer, so as to
almost touch his eyelids. He could see his comrades to the
right and to the left of the wheel; he could hear questions but
could not answer. Just as the fire wheel was about to blast
him, consciousness was lost and the fits came on.</p>

<h4><b>Case 75.</b> (<span class="smcap">Barat</span>, November, 1914.)</h4>

<p>A lieutenant, 25, an officer in a regiment on active duty
near the front, was called before a special board charged with
desertion in the face of the enemy. He had been assigned to
a certain position but not only had not complied with the
order, but had wandered off to the British sector and been
arrested there as a spy.</p>

<p>The prisoner was well developed, without stigmata; heredity,
negative. His career in the army had been courageous
and he had been advanced several ranks and was about to
be given a medal for bravery. He said that he had been
under a severe strain for several days.</p>

<p>One evening he had been given the order to attack. The
artillery opened fire. He found that the Germans had erected
barbed wire defences. The loss of men was terrific. His order
was to shoot all who held back. A poor territorial crouched
down and would not go forward&mdash;supplicating the prisoner
not to shoot him. The prisoner spared him.</p>

<p>The next night the order to attack the German trenches
was again given. This time he was overcome with anxiety
and discouragement. The last he remembers was the order
to attack. Next day he felt sick and his mind was foggy.
He remembered leaving his regiment and wandering round
for several days until he fell into the hands of the British
and was arrested. Then he understood what he had done.</p>

<p>The prisoner asked to be allowed to return to the front.
The testimony of one of the lieutenant’s men verified his
statements. On the day before he left the front he had been
anxious, had cried often, and would speak to no one. On
the day he left the trenches without permission, he was
nervous and disoriented.</p>

<p>There was no doubt that simulation could be ruled out;
the differential diagnosis lay between a “confused state of
emotional origin” and an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span> “epileptic dazed state.”</p>

<p>For epilepsy there was a history of attacks with falling to
the ground and loss of consciousness, without involuntary
micturition or biting of tongue, during the time when he was
a sergeant. Moreover, irritability and unwarranted suspiciousness
had been present at these periods. However,
there were no other epileptic symptoms; these two attacks
were isolated and of quite long duration, leaving no headache
or malaise after them. Also there was no basis for the
diagnosis “epileptic dazed state,” since there was no abrupt
commencement; the loss of consciousness was never complete
(the subject was able to converse with persons while the
attacks were on); and some remembrance was present of
incidents during the attacks.</p>

<p>For Barat, the important points are that the attacks were
preceded by long periods of anxiety and the disturbances
resulted more from moral than physiological causes.</p>

<p>The importance of the psychological factors lead the author
and his colleagues to the diagnosis “Mental confusion of
emotional origin.”</p>

<p>The board decided to return him to the interior and give
him a barracks position at the reduced rank of drill sergeant.</p>

<p>A solitary epileptic episode in an artillery officer
(slight concussion of the brain two years before)
following extraordinary campaign stress (38 artillery
battles in two months).</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 76.</b> (<span class="smcap">Bonhoeffer</span>, July, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A first lieutenant of artillery, 35, was able to count 38
artillery clashes in which he had taken part in two months
of very strenuous, almost daily fighting. Then appeared
headaches, anxiety, dizzy feelings, insomnia. Finally one
day suddenly, after eating, the lieutenant sustained a loss of
consciousness with convulsions, which sent him to his home
reserve hospital. The officer had felt nothing before his
convulsions came on. The medical report, however, yields
no doubt of the epileptic character of the attack.</p>

<p>When he was examined, there was a slight psychopathic
depression with a feeling of insufficiency, anxiety, insomnia,
restless dreams, over-sensitiveness, and a pessimistic outlook
on the future. There were no epileptic traits whatever.
There was nothing alcoholic, luetic, or arteriosclerotic about
the officer. There was nothing in the childhood or youth of
the patient, though there had been a fall two years before,
with phenomena of concussion without sequelae. In fact,
this fall with concussion had led to no medical examination.</p>

<p>As to the relation of the concussion two years before to the
epileptic attack, Bonhoeffer is inclined to interpret the case
as one of genuine “reactive” epilepsy on the basis of continuous
overstrenuous work for a period of weeks. He regards
the previous concussion as soil for this epilepsy.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> amount of stress occasionally required to bring out
epilepsy, compare Hurst’s Cases <a href="#case64">64</a> and <a href="#case80">80</a>. It may be
recalled that Bonhoeffer is decidedly of the belief that exhaustion
has not brought about any actual psychoses, calling
attention to the remarkable absence of psychoses among the
Serbians after their exhausting campaigns. A general review
of war experience indicates, according to Bonhoeffer,
the marked power of resistance of the healthy brain.</p>

<p>Nocturnal narcoleptic seizures accompanied by
spells of somnolence in the day, both to be regarded
as due to the “brain fag” of trench life.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 77.</b> (<span class="smcap">Friedmann</span>, July, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A tradesman, 23, had been in the German infantry since
the beginning of the war. Never sick, he had been, in a
general way, nervous; and a brother had had, at the age of 30
years, some sort of severe brain disease, in which he became
blind, dying a year later.</p>

<p>The man was for a long time in the trenches and proved
himself a courageous and stalwart soldier. He went to
hospital after a slight bullet wound of the leg, with a benign
paralysis of the peroneus.</p>

<p>In the hospital he began to show a somewhat pronounced
emotional depression, with a nervous tachycardia.</p>

<p>Friedmann reports the case on account of certain peculiar
seizures which, upon the man’s own story, had begun five
weeks before, in the field, although he had told no one about
them. He had never felt anything like them before. At
first, they came three to five times almost every night. He
would suddenly wake and find himself unable to move, to
speak, or even to think. These seizures, however, were not
accompanied by any feeling of anxiety or any respiratory
distress. Consciousness remained clear, and after 10 or 15
seconds, he could begin to think normally again. It was
clearly a question of psychopathic absences of a mild narcoleptic
type, occurring, however, only at night.</p>

<p>Daytimes, also, throughout the whole period in which
the nocturnal absences occurred, there were seizures of another
description. During the many hours in which he had
to sit in the trench, about twice a day for half an hour long,
he would plunge suddenly into a sort of irresistible lethargy.
Without any external occasion whatever, there would be a
feeling of great fatigue. In the spell he could not move or
think, would lean his head upon his hand. He was unable
to overcome the feeling of weariness and became convinced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
that he was ill, and that the fatigue could not be natural.
However, he did his work like the rest. Friedmann interprets
these spells as a kind of imperfect sleep.</p>

<p>The patient was physically healthy and stalwart, mentally
not excitable, and tolerably tranquil in the midst of shell
fire. He would never have been reported sick had it not
been for his wound. Aside from the tachycardia, of which
he himself complained little, nothing wrong was found in the
hospital. There was, to be sure, a feeling of discomfort
without any hysterical tinge, and sleep was restless. Aside
from the peroneus palsy, the injury made a good recovery.
The nocturnal attacks persisted; bromides and even luminal
failed of effect. There was, however, no longer any somnolence
by day. In fact, for the five weeks of observation,
there was no change in his condition.</p>

<p>Friedmann states that mild emotional alterations are not
infrequent in the trenches with minds disposed thereto,
although emotional shock, especially in shell fire, is the most
frequent cause. However, these particular seizures are quite
unusual. The stresses of field service lead to a sometimes
complete paralysis of mental power, interfering transiently
with service. There is no evidence of sudden circulatory
disturbances such as would bring about dizziness, pallor,
nausea, or fainting spells. According to Friedmann, the
regulative brain functions, especially those that maintain
consciousness, become weak on account of a condition which
he terms <i>Gehirnmüdigkeit</i>, or, as we should say in English,
brain fag. The situation forbids due completion of sleep.
Thus, the explanation of the daytime attacks follows rather
obvious lines of brain fag. The accidental awakening it is,
which at night produces the absences; the wakenings are due
to the general restlessness of the patient. The general weakening
of cerebral function produces the disorder at the moment
of wakening, since the regulative factors of consciousness
are already out of order. The condition in the absence
rather closely resembles the state of consciousness just before
going to sleep, and also perhaps the state of consciousness
during the process of awakening. It is as if the process of
waking were somehow delayed a few moments. Friedmann<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
is interested to show the relation of such absences to the so-called
<i>gehäuften kleinen Anfälle</i>, originally described by him
in 1906 as occurring in children, and distinguished from epileptic
attacks. These attacks, after lasting for years, finally
disappeared completely. The same sort of thing in adults
was symptomatic of some other disease, such as neurasthenia,
and was not a true entity. In children these attacks failed
to be attended with any mental injury, nor were there any
pronounced epileptic phenomena. Bromides had no effect
upon them, and they already showed a somewhat striking
and peculiar appearance, involving interruptions ten seconds
long of capacity to think, speak, or move, without disturbance
of consciousness or automatic movements. Sometimes
the attacks occurred from six to 100 times in the day, without
in any respect interfering with the general condition of the
child. The occurrence of such series of mild seizures is nothing
but a syndrome. To be sure, some cases turn out to
be cases of genuine epilepsy with an eventual degenerative
process. Some forms belong in the spasmophilia group, and
some among the hysterias. However, according to Friedmann,
there is a narcoleptic <i>petit mal</i> that is an entity by itself,
proceeding after a period of years to complete recovery without
complications. It is this form which may be regarded
as a peculiar kind of brain fag. The case of the soldier may
be supposed to be one which will prove to have this benign
outcome.</p>

had been at the front without leave for twelve months since
the German retreat. Leave was due him. A sister’s letter
said his brother was severely wounded and his mother was
praying for his return. When he thought these things over
an attack came. He could, however, control the attacks.
Russel told him, if he would play the game, he would be sent
to the base with a recommendation for leave. In ten days
the man was remarkably changed and had no further attacks.</p>

<p>A private, 24, in the army from 16, never epileptic (sisters

1914. Shell fire did not worry the man, but he gradually
became depressed after his father and five brothers had died

in one day in July, 1916. He was unconscious for two hours
after the second blowing up, but carried on for two hours
more until blown up for the third time.</p>

<p>After this, he became nervous and shaky, and began to
sleep badly, and a month later had a typical attack of major
epilepsy. Fits occurred with increasing frequency. As

<h4><b>Case 81.</b> (<span class="smcap">Juquelier</span> and <span class="smcap">Quellien</span>, May, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A soldier, 29 (father alcoholic, died in hospital for the insane),
a decorative painter without plumbic history, non-alcoholic,
non-syphilitic, was wounded once, September, 1914,
but returned to the front in 1915.</p>

<p>May, 1915, a shell burst near him. He lost consciousness,
regained it a few days later at Brest, and was so far
recovered that he could go on leave in seven days. While
on leave, he had short attacks of delirium, followed by a
total amnesia; there was, however, no crisis, fall, or convulsion.
After the first attack, he had for 24 hours malaise and
headache, but got well and went back to his dépôt. Shortly
afterward more attacks of this sort recurred, and he went to
hospital and thence to the neurological centre at Tours.
Whence, August 9, 1915, he got a two-months’ leave for
“mental disorder post-confusional, <i>second état</i>, probably
hysterical (<i>commotio cerebri</i>), and organic hemiparesis.”</p>

<p>November, 1915, after returning to the dépôt, there were
more spells and he went again to hospital. Invalided
December, 1915, he passed a year at home, but the spells continued.
Although the epileptic nature of these attacks was
maintained by Francais at Évreux, he was placed in the
auxiliaries, December, 1916, but had to go to hospital almost
at once, and, February 28, 1917, entered the neurological
centre of the 9th Region for the second time. Here, when
called to be examined two days after admission, he was
observed in an attack. He suddenly rose from the bench,
made a few steps, seemed to be listening and anxious, as if
he ought to be on guard. He looked up, seemed to be looking
for something whose noise was approaching, lowered his
head, made a slight jerking movement, and said, “Poum!”
as if to express the noise of an explosion. He took a few
more steps, the same movements were repeated, and the
same “Poum!” was uttered. This lasted for about a quarter
of an hour, during which the patient was unaware of his
surroundings. He could be guided all about the hall without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
resistance, but did not respond to orders, commands, noises,
or contact. In short, the patient was in the midst of a
hallucinatory dream at his post in the trenches, undergoing
a bombardment. He was placed in a chair; remained
motionless for a few seconds, woke up, and answered questions.
“Where am I? Oh, yes; I must have been sick
because my head feels bad.” In answer to the question.
“What did you see; what was there?”, he said, “I don’t
remember anything. I never remember. I don’t know.”
The patient was dull and weak after the spell.</p>

<p>These spells varied in number but occurred once a week.
The patient was able to tell of certain attacks that had
occurred while he was out of doors at home.</p>

<p>Now and then, there was another theme in the hallucinatory
delirium, namely, a pencil drawing of a woman’s
picture, of no great artistic worth but carefully done, at
which the patient was much astonished on awaking.</p>

<p>It seems as if auto- and hetero-suggestion can be eliminated
from the genesis of these attacks. Neither hysterical
nor epileptic crises have preceded or ever alternated with
these seizures. Nevertheless, on the organic side, the patient
had a general increase of tendon reflexes on the left side, most
marked in the knee-jerk, and fell to the left in voltaic vertigo.
There was a left hemiparesis, apparently of organic
origin, which had been determined as far back as July, 1915.</p>

<p>There was no true dementia. Past memories were but
slowly recalled, and inattention interfered with the fixation
of recent memory. He complained of troubles in his sleep
and dreamed of war experiences somewhat analogous to those
in his attack of amnestic delirium. After the seizure, there
was a marked hebetude and mental inactivity, torpor, and a
severe headache. The case was presented to a special commission
as one of epilepsia larvata in a person hereditarily
predisposed who had never before presented epileptic signs,
suffering from a disease characterized by frequent short
attacks of hallucinatory and delirious automatism, following
shell explosion which had at the same time produced a slight
left-sided hemiparesis and mental inhibition.</p>

by Ballard.</p>

<p>Blindness for a month followed recovery of consciousness.
“Neurasthenia” (anxiety neurosis) after return of sight.
Apparently nearly complete recovery after latent period of
a few weeks. Return of blindness in one eye in December.
Five days automatic wandering (the man was found in a
west country town five days after leaving home to rejoin his
dépôt and seen by a medical officer who reported that he was
dazed and amnestic for that period); admission to second
Eastern General Hospital, December 15.</p>

<p>On admission he proved to be suffering from minor hysterical
symptoms such as an inability to open his eyes and to
see clearly when the lids were raised. The symptoms rapidly
cleared up under suggestive conversation and did not return
except for amnesia and slight emotional depression. He remained
well until December 25. On that day he began for
the first time to have definite epileptic fits and nocturnal
epileptic delirium. In January he was discharged as an
epileptic. There was no epileptic temperament or feeblemindedness.
Finally, there had never been any personal or
family neuropathic or psychopathic history.</p>

<h4 id="case83"><b>Case 83.</b> (<span class="smcap">Ballard</span>, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A soldier was blown up, April, 1915, and had a spell of
unconsciousness. Later, pains in the head, slight amnesia
and a condition of asthenia developed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>He was eventually admitted to the second Eastern General
Hospital at Brighton, January, 1916. At the time of admission
he was semiconscious, stuporous, confused, disoriented,
anxious in a dull sort of way, talking about his expectation of
“a sailor with a card.” Speech was intelligible, though fragmentary
and infrequent. The man obeyed commands but
gave no replies to questions. The mental processes were
slow and impaired.</p>

<p>According to Ballard, we have here a case of epileptic confusion,
eight months after the initial concussion. This particular
attack ceased three days later, leaving amnesia for the
attack and a certain amount of mental retardation. The
man was not epileptic in temperament and his personal and
family history proved negative.</p>

<h4 id="case84"><b>Case 84.</b> (<span class="smcap">Ballard</span>, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A soldier was buried in a mine explosion, October, 1915,
and for several days thereafter was unconscious or semi-conscious.
He emerged deaf and subject to stammering and
a condition termed “neurasthenic.” The stammering was
soon replaced by mutism, which lasted several weeks. The
mutism was then supplanted by epileptic fits.</p>

<p>He was observed by Ballard in a dreamlike, disoriented
and inaccessible state, in which he was anesthetic to pin
pricks, lay awestruck, dumbly following with his finger hallucinatory
airplanes. Flexibilitas cerea was also shown at
this time.</p>

<p>Next day he emerged from the dreamlike state with mental
processes somewhat slowed, disorientation for time, amnesia
for the attack, memory disturbance and a return of
the stammer. On the next day following, all these symptoms
had disappeared except amnesia for the attack. Another
spell of epileptic fits occurred later. It seems that the
man had had a convulsion thirteen years before and occasional
convulsions since. In fact, he, seven years before,
had had what was called “a stroke” and residuals of a slight
hemiplegia were still present. (There is no statement in the
case report relative to syphilis.)</p>

<h4><b>Case 85.</b> (<span class="smcap">Mott</span>, January, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A man, 19, suffered from shock due to emotional stress and
shell fire. He had terrifying dreams. After a short time,
he developed paroxysmal attacks of maniacal excitement.
Just before the first attack he had been helping in the kitchen,
lay down on his bed, went to sleep, woke, startled,
flushed, and sweating, and made for the door as if terrified.
He remained in this state as if suffering from hallucinations
of sight and hearing, and without ability to recognize his
wife, the doctors, or the Sisters. When two strangers in
uniform came in to observe him, the adjutant became violent,
as if the uniforms had started terror anew. The attacks
lasted from a few hours to a few days, coming on suddenly,
without apparent cause. One day he tried to get over the
wall of the playground. He came back and buried his head
in his hands. Major Mott spoke to him, whereupon he got
up, looking terrified, made for the door, and four orderlies
were required for his restraint. At Napsbury Hospital, to
which he was sent, he made a complete recovery.</p>

<p>Mott suggests that we are dealing with a psychic equivalent
of epilepsy.</p>

<h4><b>Case 86.</b> (<span class="smcap">Boucherot</span>, 1915-6.)</h4>

<p>A Territorial infantryman, aged 37, was in the habit of
drinking a good deal without getting drunk, and at the front
drank a good deal of bad brandy. He had just taken a considerable
quantity when his regiment got the order to charge.
The charge was hardly over when the man became greatly
excited and hallucinated. He thought he was surrounded by
Germans and tried to transfix his comrades with the bayonet.
Howling and struggling he was carried to the rear.</p>

<p>He was soon brought to the asylum at Fleury after howling
all night and seeing the Boches and animals fighting
among themselves. His hands and tongue were tremulous
and there were cramps in the calves of his legs. On the 6th
he expressed astonishment to find himself in hospital and
was found to have but slight memory of what had happened.
He remembered, however, that he had tried to kill his comrades.
With the deprivation of alcohol he became rapidly
normal and was sent back to the dépôt in a few days.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> alcoholism under army conditions, Lépine remarks that
alcohol has played in this war a rôle analogous to that of
malaria in the epidemiology of some countries. Many of
the victims are, to start with, unbalanced subjects and
<i>détraqués</i> who are hereditary alcoholics. Alcoholism, according
to Lépine, dominates the pathology of the interior and
has a marked bearing upon conditions at the front. In
fact, alcoholism would have been disastrous in France had
not measures been taken against it; measures still insufficient
(1917). More than one-third of 6000 cases studied by Lépine
during three years have shown alcohol as a sole or, at all
events, principal cause of the difficulty. It would be within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
reason to state, according to Lépine, that if we throw in
cases in which alcoholism was a partial factor, more than
half, or even more than two-thirds, of the mental cases had
been strongly influenced by alcohol. Lépine thinks there
may be effects like those of anaphylaxis. Certainly, the
startling and sudden effects in so-called pathological intoxication,
as in <a href="#case86">Case 86</a>, suggest the critical and vehement
effects seen in the sensitized anaphylactic subject.</p>

<p>Pathological intoxication: criminal prosecution
stopped.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 87.</b> (<span class="smcap">Loewy</span>, 1915.)</h4>

<p>An orderly, in private life a teacher, one day about <i>noon-time</i>,
when going on duty, called the commanding officer to
account because he (the orderly) had had to wait. He said
he had been ordered to come at <i>two</i> o’clock and it was already
long thereafter! He was severely reprimanded but
addressed a number of the officers present with questions
having no relation to military service. In fact, he seemed
to have forgotten entirely that he was on military service.</p>

<p>This was the more remarkable as the teacher-orderly had
many times distinguished himself upon dangerous patrol
expeditions and in critical situations, winning the confidence
of his superiors and the likelihood of promotion to corporal.
He had been a discreet, earnest, and clever soldier.</p>

<p>Loewy observed him during this affair and noticed that
he did not by language or movement suggest intoxication or
hilarity but merely a certain excitement. He was entirely
oriented for time, place and person, and his outward behavior
was correct enough except for his military rank.</p>

<p>Sent to his quarters near by, he gave the impression to his
immediate superior officer of deep drunkenness. He murmured
something and soon fell into a deep sleep. After
waking, he had an almost complete amnesia, knowing only
that something disagreeable had transpired. He remembered
that he had been offered several little glasses of cognac
brandy by a comrade, and that he had drained them off
quickly before going on duty. He said that he had never
drunk cognac before, and in fact had drunk nothing for a
long time.</p>

<p>The diagnosis of pathological intoxication was made, and
the soldier was thereby cleared of his dangerous situation;
a criminal prosecution was not instituted. He thereafter
behaved with entire sobriety and modesty, and he achieved
his corporalcy and later became file leader.</p>

<p>Desertion in alcoholism may deserve the term
“pathological.” Case of fugue.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 88.</b> (<span class="smcap">Logre</span>, July, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A “deserter” said: “I went because I drank a glass. I
just went, <i>comme ça</i>, without any motive.” He was somewhat
feebleminded and, in explaining the impulsivity of his
act, he added: “I went like a broken-down beast. I walked
straight ahead, without knowing where I was going and if I
had been going to be killed, it would have been all the same
to me.” He could not that afternoon remember very well;
but next morning, after having slept, he regained full consciousness.
He said that he then found himself in a field
near a cemetery. He had carried his gun and equipment
with him, but had lost them somewhere, and from a military
point of view, his desertion was complicated by loss of effects.
On coming to, he said to himself, “Where am I? How
foolish after fifteen months in the line! Probably I have
deserted again.” In fact, he had a month before left his
post under exactly the same conditions in the midst of a
period of alcoholic excitement.</p>

<p>This alcoholic fugue is typical: drunkenness, impulsive and
subconscious ambulatory automatism, with partial amnesia,
disorientation, with mislaying of objects, followed by sleep
and immediate return to normality.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> fugue, see discussion under Cases <a href="#case58">58</a> and <a href="#case59">59</a>. The
French military code cannot excuse victims of fugue even
though executed in a quite unconscious state, if the fugue
is due to alcohol. There was a certain procursive suggestion
in the fugue of <a href="#case88">Case 88</a>, who went “like a broken-down
beast,” straight ahead, without knowing where he was going.</p>

<p>Alcoholism: Amnesia experimentally reproduced.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 89.</b> (<span class="smcap">Kastan</span>, January, 1916.)</h4>

<p>February 15, 1915, a German soldier drank beer in the
canteen and at roll-call appeared tipsy. He then went to
bed, but rose an hour later to go to town. A quarter of an
hour later, he went to a clerk’s house and asked for paper,
on the ground that the next day he was going to march to
Warsaw. The clerk gave him no paper, which he then tried
to get by force. A policeman arrested him and he said,
“You just wait, lame dog!” Upon examination he denied
that he had ever been guilty of any crime but had been in
institutions on account of delirium. In point of fact, this
man had grown up in very bad surroundings, amongst quarrels
and disputes of his parents, who kept a disorderly house.
At 19 he had been convicted of incest. He finally admitted
having been convicted for rape. It was found that he had
once run out into the front trenches; had been removed by an
advance guard to a stable, and then wondered why he was
not in school. He described a number of attacks of delirium
although he had not drunk more than moderately.</p>

<p>He was given an experimental dose of 50 c.c. of alcohol,
and in ten minutes became excited, tried to get out of bed,
attacked other patients without reason, and was able to
speak neither spontaneously nor in response to questions.
In a period of two hours he became clear and asked what
the trouble was. He knew only that he had taken alcohol.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> the experimental excitement produced in Kastan’s case
by the exhibition of alcohol, it is of note that Bérard has been
much impressed by the agitation that surgical cases of alcoholism
undergo when anesthetized. It may be that the anesthetics
act similarly to the experimental alcoholism of
Kastan’s case. According to Bérard, these phenomena of
the anesthetized wounded (who are men recently evacuated
from the front and other hospital cases) are of larval alcoholism
brought out by the anesthesia. Bérard wonders whether
rum issues at the front are at all responsible therefor.</p>

<p>Desertion, drunk. Contributory factors.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 90.</b> (<span class="smcap">Kastan</span>, January, 1916.)</h4>

<p>Gottlieb S. left the barracks, January 25, 1915, met friends
and drank with them, remaining all night in the railway
restaurant and waiting room. He was promptly arrested.</p>

<p>According to the patient, he had always drunk a good deal
and had once fallen from his horse in the campaign, and become
unconscious. After this fall, he said he had been able
to stand less alcohol than before.</p>

<p>There is doubt as to the syphilis of Gottlieb. He said he
had been infected once, but his further statement that he
had six relapses is, of course, questionable. As to the hypothesis
of feeblemindedness, it appears that in childhood he
had learned badly and had been a stammerer. He had been a
herdsman, and after that a laborer. He finally became a
travelling man for a specialty photographer.</p>

<p>He had previously been convicted of an embezzlement,
brawling, and breach of the peace.</p>

<p>As to his military crime, he said he had been celebrating
the emperor’s birthday the last three days, being urged on by
acquaintances and drinking whiskey. He was, in fact, on a
spree and did not eat properly. He had met a student in
the railway station and had forgotten all about his military
service. He remembered having spoken with the waiter,
remembered telling the student that he was going to commit
suicide, and the student had drunk seltzer with him. January
29, he for some reason drank no more, and then it
occurred to him that he ought to go back to duty. He
remembered that he was easily led astray. He had once
thought of becoming a tanner but had been dissuaded from
the trade because of its bad smell.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The analysis of this case must consider, first, syphilis.
Supposing, however, that this hypothesis is not substantiated
by laboratory findings, the hypothesis of
feeblemindedness might well be raised. It seems possible,
if not probable, that this patient was in the
subnormal group, lying between normality and feeble-mindedness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
proper. The value of mental tests would
here be extreme. There seems to be no evident epilepsy,
and the majority of the phenomena can perhaps
best be explained by alcoholism. Possibly the case is
one of so-called pathological intoxication. The patient’s
own story that, although he had been always
subject to drink, he had been less tolerant of alcohol
since a fall from his horse, seems to be entirely consistent
with the post-traumatic history of numerous cases,
so that it would hardly be wise to consider that alcohol
accounts for the whole story. We must raise then in
succession the hypothesis of syphilis, feeblemindedness,
alcoholism, and coarse brain disease, bearing in mind
also early stammering. As to the utilization of such a
man, it would appear that a supervision of him with
absolute countermanding of alcohol in view of the decrease
in tolerance of alcohol since the fall from his
horse might perhaps preserve this man for some form
of military service.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Re</i> German and French war alcoholism, Soukhanoff remarks
that the conditions in these countries were in strong
contrast to those in Russia. In Russia there was a great
decrease in the number of cases of acute alcoholic psychosis;
particularly at the time of mobilization, there were few cases
of alcoholic psychosis. He says that during the Russo-Japanese
war, alcoholic psychoses constituted a third of all
the mental cases observed. This figure corresponds with
that quoted above from Lépine (see under <a href="#case86">Case 86</a>). Soukhanoff,
writing in 1915, had not observed personally a single
case of alcoholic psychosis. Incidentally, the number of
cases of psychosis in the Russian army had remained in
general small.</p>

<p>Desertion by mild alcoholic dement.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 91.</b> (<span class="smcap">Kastan</span>, January, 1916.)</h4>

<p>Emil S. made a number of statements when he came for
examination. He had once had a treatment by injections.
Both his mother and his grandmother had been insane. He
said that his brother was an officer in the navy, but this
statement was found to be false.</p>

<p>According to his story, he had lost touch with his troop at
the end of September, 1914, and had lived in several lodgings
in T&mdash;&mdash; up to October 19, when he was arrested. He said
that he did not know that a man who had lost touch with his
troop had to report.</p>

<p>A week after his arrest, S. entered a shop and asked for
coffee, saying that he had a furlough of 24 hours and wanted
cake for his comrades. He said he was the owner of an
estate and would send a roebuck for the cakes. The shop-man
gave him cakes to the value of one mark. Bystanders
said that he had been lodging in T&mdash;&mdash; for about two weeks.
It seems that he had told his landlady that a city official
had quartered him upon her and that he was on furlough.
He went away in the morning and came back in the evening.
He had written to a bank of which he had once been a representative,
asking for money. One night he had lodged with
another landlady, being given a meal, and he had there
stated that he was in the City of T&mdash;&mdash; on duty and that his
horse was in the barracks. He offered a thousand marks
for his board and lodging.</p>

<p>At another lodging he had given himself out as a courier.
In fact, the letter to the above-mentioned bank had been
signed “Otto S., Land-owner, at present, courier.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If I do not revoke this in person or by writing on
January 1, 1915, I beg you to pay to Mr. and Mrs. M.
of T&mdash;&mdash;, one thousand marks and deduct it from my
balance.</p>

<p>“This is to be considered as my last will. As witness:
present: Joseph B.”</p>

</div>

<p>The letter was addressed “To the direction of Commercial-Counsellor
P&mdash;&mdash;.” There was no stamp on the letter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>A second letter reads:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Honored Sir, Commercial Counsellor:</p>

<p>I beg you to send by return mail to the address given
below 1000 marks, and deduct this amount from my
account. I have been in Russia. Well, things are
moving now. Thank God, we have reached the point
we have. Write me please more in detail about my
property and estate and give me your very valuable
advice.</p>

<p>With best regards to your esteemed wife, I remain</p>

<p>Sincerely and respectfully yours,</p>

<p>Otto S., at present courier,
otherwise, land-owner.”</p>

</div>

<p>As for this Commercial-Counsellor P., P.’s son stated that
his father had been dead for three years and a half.</p>

<p>S. gave himself out in T&mdash;&mdash; as a land-owner, falsifying
his name, asking for beer to the amount of a mark a day,
borrowing from his landlady ten marks, paying nothing, but
remaining on friendly terms with the landlady and her women
lodgers, making a contract with a superintendent ostensibly
for his estate, and borrowing money from him.</p>

<p>Observed in the clinic, he said he was a bank representative
and had been very nervous since being divorced in
1911. The divorce was due to his wife’s adultery. Sometimes
he would not know really what he was doing, once even
tried to shoot himself, and again once threw a burning lamp
into his wife’s face without knowing it.</p>

<p>He had gone to the City of T&mdash;&mdash; without furlough in
October because others used to, too. Only five days later
had he noticed that his troop was no longer there; and upon
inquiring about the troop he could find nothing as to its
whereabouts.</p>

<p>He had been a heavy drinker and was always somewhat
intoxicated, which, according to the patient, made him forget
everything. He had drunk 20 glasses of beer and liquor
daily. He wrote to P. because he knew his father.</p>

<p>As for the frauds, he said he knew nothing about them.
He did not know even the baker from whom he had gotten
the cakes. In fact, he had been drunk the whole day long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>He said that he had learned badly in school and had not
passed any examinations. In active service he had already
been convicted of drunkenness once. Referring to his treatment
by injections, he said he would rather be dead. He
had only sought diversion in looking over estates. Both his
ability to reckon and his memory had suffered greatly. He
and another patient eloped from the clinic one day but were
captured a few hours later.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Remarks: Details are lacking as to the physical and
laboratory side of this case. On the whole, there appeared
to be no convincing features of paresis or cerebrospinal
syphilis. The phenomena are very possibly
in part alcoholic. There appeared to be no sensory
disorders, and in particular no hallucinations. The intellectual
disorder is chiefly amnestic. There is little
or no evidence of emotional abnormality. The curious
conduct seems hardly to indicate a primary disorder of
will. The main feature psychologically appears to be
amnesia coupled with an inability to reckon. To be
sure, the letters are written externally in sufficiently
good form; the amnesia does not appear to extend to
details. It is a question of whether the disorientation
which one suspects is not merely amnestic. On the
whole, however, it would appear that there must have
been at various times disorder of consciousness, as indeed
is indicated by the patient’s own account of his
ignorance of the cake-roebuck episode.</p>

<p>Dismissing the hypothesis of a syphilitic dementia,
we might cling to that of alcoholic dementia more or
less punctuated by acute alcoholism. Yet it is also
possible that the patient was actually somewhat feeble-minded;
this would be consistent with his own statement.
The question might arise whether this soldier
could have been excluded by careful psychiatric examination
before entering service. It would seem that
a knowledge of the insanity of the mother and grandmother,
and an inspection of school records, if available,&mdash;to
say nothing of the episodes which may or may
not have been accurately related, between himself and
his afterwards divorced wife&mdash;would have sufficed to
throw doubt upon the military effectiveness of this
man. We know also that he had already been convicted
of drunkenness on military service before the
episodes mentioned.</p>

<p>Desertion by alcoholic. Contributory factors.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 92.</b> (<span class="smcap">Kastan</span>, January, 1916.)</h4>

<p>Carl B. was a soldier about whom the captain thought that
his intellectual power had been weakened by drink. An
inquiry after arrest showed that he had been odd also at
home. He had once been sued for perjury, but the suit had
been stopped for lack of evidence. He had been several
times convicted of drunkenness. It appears that on March
30, 1915, after mounting guard, he said nothing and went
home, remaining at home until the next day and then returned
to the guardhouse in the street-car. He declared,
this time, that the non-commissioned officer had given him
permission to leave, although this statement was not correct.</p>

<p>Again, on April 6, B. was about to leave the quarters,
but the surgeon, finding him drunk, kept him back. He
did not go home that night, and the next day when he was
wanted at the hearing, he could be found only in the afternoon.
He replied confusedly and somewhat irrelevantly
to the questions asked. On arrival at the clinic he was in
tears and much depressed. Given 50 grams of alcohol, he
became somewhat livelier. Upon examination, his perceptions
were found diminished; he felt, he stated, a cracking
and crackling in his neck. In his cell he had felt as if sparrows
were roosting in his face; he had heard voices and seen
pictures, and had not known what he was doing. He asserted
his innocence, blaming his imprisonment for all his
troubles. He had been in the habit of drinking three
liqueurs and two glasses of beer a day. He had been drawing
a pension since a fall from a scaffold.</p>

<p>A sister had suffered from continual headaches. The
patient himself had three sickly children and ten of his
children were dead; there were also two premature births.</p>

<p>The analysis of this case would clearly show the
benefit of considering, first, the hypothesis of syphilis.
Not only is the history of his children suggestive, but
the impairment of mind noted by the captain as due to
alcohol may very possibly be syphilitic in origin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Examples in division he could not solve, and it is a question
whether his leaving guardmount is not in part
related to disorientation for time. There appears to
be no evidence of feeblemindedness and none of epilepsy
(though a sister suffered from continual headaches).
Alcohol may account possibly for the entire
picture and is particularly consistent with the false
voices and figures, the sparrows in the face, and the
sensations in neck and the tickling in the ears. It is
possible, also, that intolerance to alcohol had set in
since the fall from the scaffolding for which a pension
was being received. It does not appear necessary to
consider any further of the groups of mental disease.
Syphilis, alcohol, and a post-traumatic brain condition,
all may play a part. Alcohol is able probably by itself
to produce a number of these symptoms, and these alcoholic
symptoms would be probably the more readily
produced in virtue of the post-traumatic intolerance
that we may assume.</p>

<p>A disciplinary case: Alcoholism.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 93.</b> (<span class="smcap">Kastan</span>, January, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A German soldier, brought up for examination for disobedience
and insubordination with intoxication, was found
already to have been convicted 33 times of a variety of
crimes. Once he had drunk a bottle of shoemaker’s polish,
evidently with suicidal intent.</p>

<p>In the canteen he had assaulted superior officers and tried
to strike a sergeant. He said he had been attacked by the sergeant
and pushed into a cell, whereupon he had lost his mind.</p>

<p>He came from a family of drunkards, and had been himself
very alcoholic formerly. On the day in question, however,
he had drunk very little. According to his account,
he had fits of this sort if any one injured him. He was
amnestic and had forgotten his previous convictions. Anything
he might have done, he said, had happened a long
time ago, in his youth. For example, concerning a theft, he
said that it was merely that he had fallen into some Christmas
trees and stuck fast there, and no one wanted to be
paid. Tremors of hands, feet, head. Analgesia of thorax.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> alcoholism and disciplinary cases, we find alcoholism
bulking large in Lépine’s account of military delinquency.
Fugue subjects are not infrequently alcoholic. Minor disobedience
is also often alcoholic. Acts of violence are characteristically
alcoholic, or executed by subjects with hereditary
alcoholic taint. (Such acts were in France especially
common before the anti-absinthe law in 1915.) Alcoholic
episodes and impulses often culminate in arson. No doubt,
espionage employs alcoholism for a portion of its technique,
though delusional mystics and subnormal hypersuggestibles
are more often the purveyors of information to the enemy.
The theft list, also, shows its share of alcoholics. Alcoholics
are less common amongst those who, contrary to rules,
assume shoulder-straps or other decorations. Here the sub-normals
and victims of imbalance, as well as the drug cases,
are more likely to figure if the matter is psychiatric at all.</p>

<h4><b>Case 94.</b> (<span class="smcap">Kastan</span>, January, 1916.)</h4>

<p>April 15, 1915, a German soldier went with three comrades
to a farm, to select a sheep for slaughter; they were obliged
to go to three farms. The man carried a revolver and cartridges
in his pocket. He threatened the farmer that he met
with this revolver, and desired to rape the farmer’s daughter.
He was very drunk, and said to the non-commissioned officer
who was called in at the time, “You have served only a year
longer than I have.” He staggered, struck violently with his
hand at the sergeant, and gave insolent replies.</p>

<p>He had already choked the peasant’s daughter, scratched
her face, and bitten her fingers, hand and arm. She could
not run away as she was lame. The soldier held the revolver
to her face and shot it off several times, offered sex assault,
scratched her feet with his spurs, and tried to twist her neck.
The non-commissioned officer threatened to shoot him, and
he then became still. He said to the first-lieutenant before
whom he was taken, that he would do anything but allow
himself to be beaten, and at this moment moved his arms
about in the air, and bloody foam came from his mouth.
The first-lieutenant previously had always thought him to
be normal except for a strange flicker and unrest of the eyes.
There was a history that he had already once attacked a
servant girl. The man had amnesia for the affair, only
remembering how the non-commissioned officer had come on
a white horse. He remembered nothing about the peasant
and the girl. He said that he had been given to earache on
the right side in winter. There was a history of his having
fallen from a tree in childhood, becoming unconscious. He
had been a sufficiently good scholar up to the second class
in school. He had been an excellent soldier.</p>

</div>

<h4><b>Case 95.</b> (<span class="smcap">Kastan</span>, January, 1916.)</h4>

<p>September 15, 1914, a German soldier was missed. He
had said that he wanted to get to the enemy quickly, and that
he was going to march alone against the Russians. A shot
was fired that night by this soldier, on the ground that he had
been insulted by a civilian, although no civilian was present.</p>

<p>September 21, a farmer in a wagon reached a farm, where
he found the soldier aiming at a woman. He fired, wounded
the woman severely, and jumped on the farmer’s wagon and
rode off with him. It seems that the soldier had come to
the farm at noontime and accused the woman of treachery,
ordering her to come with her husband to a certain farmhouse,
where she should be placed against the wall and be shot. The
soldier had shot her and wounded her husband also. According
to the woman, the idea was to take revenge because
she had denounced certain persons as spies.</p>

<p>He was arrested during the night, and told how he had left
his troop because he could not get at the enemy. He had
been informed that there were spies who ought to be shot;
there had been talk in a certain inn about it. He did not
know he had wounded the husband, and he only wanted to
give that dangerous woman a piece of his mind.</p>

<p>After wounding the woman, he had given himself no
further thought about her, but had gone to partake of the
holy sacrament at the pastor’s. He then had drunk another
glass of beer and gone to bed. He was, in fact, still drunk
at the time of arrest. He had not been aware that he would
be punished for the crime of going alone against the Russians.</p>

<p>Some days later, he wrote that he did not intend to kill the
woman, that he had been drunk at the time and was always
a bad man when drunk; that he had other times when he
absented himself from home for days when drunk. He had
had, he said, a number of attacks of delirium, in which he
had seen animals. At one time, he had fallen on his head.
On the day in question, he had drunk 1½ litres of liquor. He
was remorseful for his deed.</p>

<p>A disciplinary case: Alcoholism; amnesia.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 96.</b> (<span class="smcap">Kastan</span>, January, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A German soldier, New Year’s Eve, 1915, got away from
his company, drank whiskey, and came back drunk. He
bothered his comrades so that the non-commissioned officer
had to call for help; whereupon the soldier said, “A man who
comes on late and hasn’t been in much, hasn’t much to say.
If it is a non-commissioned officer, I shall hit him in the
snout.” The officer kept talking to him kindly but he cried
“<i>Halt’s Maul</i>, you crooked …!” He staggered up to the
lieutenant without saluting, but at a slight push fell prone
into the straw.</p>

<p>It transpired that the man had not been intoxicated
enough to lose all control of himself. He did not remember
anything about what he had done; he had drunk a half-bottle
of rum during the evening. There was a demonstrable
lack of memory. He did not know the German provinces,
and thought that Bismarck had once been war minister.
There was a tremor, hypalgesia of the left leg and analgesia
of the left arm and left shoulder.</p>

<p>It was found that he came from a strongly tainted family,
with two insane sisters and three insane cousins. He had
been a good soldier during his service, but had accused his
father of alcoholism baselessly. He had always been difficult
to manage when drunk and had been convicted nine times:
five for dangerous assault and battery. He drank up to 1⅓
litres of whiskey a day if he got time, and also took ether.
For some ten years he had been amnestic for what he did
while drunk; nor, according to his wife, had he been able
recently to stand so much alcohol. He said that he had had
a fall from a wagon in 1911 or ’12, after which he had been
unconscious.</p>

<h4><b>Case 97.</b> (<span class="smcap">Kastan</span>, January, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A German soldier was advanced in rank February 26,
1915, and in honor thereof drank six or seven glasses of beer.
On his way home, he met a captain and failed to salute him.
When called to account, he said he could not see, and made
remarks about regrettable behavior. He refused to go along
with the officer. Afterwards he remembered that he had
been stopped by an officer but had forgotten subsequent
happenings.</p>

<p>March 24, he was riding in an electric car with a lieutenant.
He said to the lieutenant who had unbuckled his sabre, “It
is a piece of insolence and improper to unbuckle the sabre.”
He repeated the phrase on questioning. He was then asked
to give his name, and replied, “I know my name but what is
your name, Mr. Lieutenant?” He looked drunk at the time
but afterwards remembered nothing.</p>

<p>Physically he was tremulous and showed blepharospasm.
His face grew red on bending over.</p>

<p>This man had been run over by an automobile in 1910,
after which he had become excitable, slow-thinking and
forgetful. The spinous processes were painful on pressure,
as was also the hip joint. The history showed that he had
been convicted six times of various crimes, such as disturbing
the peace, embezzlement, and the like. Since this accident
he had not been able to work effectively. He had gone into
the army in a spirit of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Adventure with a stranger in Paris.</p>

<h4><b>Case 98.</b> (<span class="smcap">Briand</span> and <span class="smcap">Haury</span>, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A soldier had seven days’ leave in Paris, beginning December
27, 1915, and the first day drank a good deal of wine with
another man on leave. They met, in some place that the
patient had forgotten, a well-dressed man whom they did not
know, and all three fell to drinking. The stranger told them
he knew a trick to prolong the leave to 3 or 4 weeks. “All I
have got to do is to prick you, and it will cost only 100 sous.”
The operation was done at the café after payment in advance.
The operation was a puncture with a needle between the
middle and ring fingers of the left hand. Next day there was
a phlegmon of the dorsal surface of the hand, and he was put
into hospital saying that he had gotten a barbed wire prick
in the trenches. The surgeon who opened the phlegmon was
surprised at its gummy appearance, gangrenous odor, and
greenish tint. In point of fact, petrol had been injected.</p>

but was too excited to be kept there. Accordingly,
she had to be sent to Sainte-Anne, but upon arrival she
developed distinct signs of tetanus.</p>

<p>It seems that Mdm. L. was the widow of a Colonial who
had given her the first injections ten years before, for dysentery.
She tried several times to stop. Daily dose 1.5 grams.</p>

<p>She was in a cachectic state, and according to her mother,
took no care of her syringe, trailing it about everywhere.
Her thighs, arms, and anterior aspect of the body were covered
with scars. There were small phlegmons in places. Did she
inoculate herself with bacillus tetani from an infected needle?
In any case, she died of tetanus.</p>

<p>A man worked in Paris on the ’Change, where there are a
number of syringe victims. He had been brought up in Paris
but was not a Frenchman. Enthused by his friends and the
prey of deep emotion, he enlisted. He was of an introspective
nature and himself wondered whether the morphine did not
have something to do with his enlisting. He said, “I had
been unnerved for a number of days by reading the papers,
and after a number of heavy injections, I went to a recruiting
station and signed on.” In his regiment, he continued the
injections, but shortly found that he would be unable to
replenish his diminishing stock of drug. He explained his
unhappy fate to the corps physician, and was sent to Val-de-Grâce.
He asked to be retired, alleging that he was under
the influence of a poison when he went to the recruiting office
and had therefore committed an illegal act.</p>

<p>Fernand and Emilienne were two recidivists in morphinism.
Although neither was over 22 years of age, both had been
several times convicted of shop-lifting. They stole only if
they had no money for morphine. Prostitution served to
care for Emilienne, while Fernand was at times a cocaine
seller, and at times made money in devious ways at Montmartre.
Emilienne’s patronage scattered with the war, and
it was the same with Fernand’s. Accordingly, there was no
money for either morphine or cocaine. Moreover, the shops
being not crowded were easier to watch. As Emilienne did
not care to be arrested and sent off as an undesirable, she
presented herself at the hospital for the insane at Sainte-Anne.
Fernand shortly joined her there.</p>

<p>Left-sided hemiplegia and aphasia: Contrecoup and
local lesions.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 103.</b> (<span class="smcap">Lhermitte</span>, June, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A soldier of 23 was wounded in the left parietal region and
showed a <i>left</i>-sided hemiplegia with aphasia. The speech
difficulty, although very marked, retrograded almost completely,
but the hemiplegia remained severe. This hemiplegia
was a spastic one, of a classical nature, with Babinski
sign and exaggeration of tendon reflexes. Lhermitte thinks
that the left hemisphere was directly affected by the contusion,
as in point of fact there was an actual loss of bony
tissue, but that it would not be necessary to suppose the
ipsilateral hemiplegia was due to an absence of pyramidal
decussation. The transient aphasia was probably due to
direct affection of the tissues on the left side of the brain; the
permanent hemiplegia was doubtless due to a lesion of the
opposite hemisphere produced by contrecoup. It appears
that sometimes a surgeon may be led to superfluous surgical
intervention in a case of such paradoxical hemiplegia, since
the surgeon may believe that a bullet or shell fragment has
traversed the brain substance to the opposite side of the skull,
when as a matter of fact the brain parts have been injured
merely by contrecoup.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> such amnesia, it is of note that many head cases, even
if they do not show amnesia, show a conspicuous euphoria
and lack of understanding of the seriousness of the injury
in question and of the necessary treatment. According to
E. Meyer, there are constantly to be found in head cases
disturbances of perception and lack of coördination (especially
for time), perseveration, difficulty in thinking and
calculating.</p>

<p>Gunshot wound of head; alcoholism: Amnesia.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 104.</b> (<span class="smcap">Kastan</span>, January, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A German soldier had a bullet pass through his right eye
and lower jaw, leaving a fistulous opening from the mouth.
He said that he was completely blind, but ophthalmological
examination cast doubt upon the blindness. There had been
immediately after the injury a number of severe attacks of
dizziness, which lasted several hours; and another attack
developed after he had come back from hospital, to which he
had gone by reason of his pains.</p>

<p>He was to be arrested on account of a disciplinary crime
and had ostensibly gone to his mother’s house, there to await
arrest. The non-commissioned officer found him in a saloon.
As soon as the phrase, “You are my prisoner!” was said, the
soldier lost track of his surroundings. He had drunk a few
glasses of beer but did not himself think he was drunk at the
time. He was insulting and violent when asked to proceed
with the officer, and a policeman was called in to take charge.
He then lay down in the street and had to be put upon a
wagon, still firing abusive phrases at his captors.</p>

<p>Upon examination, aside from the effects of the gunshot,
excessive knee-jerks and tremors of the body were found.
The eyebrows met but there was no other sign of bodily
stigmata. There seems to have been no hereditary disease,
or any history of severe alcoholism, though the man had been
convicted previously of violence and theft. The amnesia is
to be ascribed to effects of the head injury.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="case105">
<p>Bullet in brain: Crises; cortical blindness; vertigo;
hallucinations.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 105.</b> (<span class="smcap">Lereboullet and Mouzon</span>, July, 1917.)</h4>

<p>An invalided soldier, 40, was sent to be observed, Oct. 23,
1916, because he wanted his pension renewed. He had been
retired a year before for diminution of binocular vision with
impaired perspective of objects in the right half of the visual
field. He had now become completely blind.</p>

<p>He had been wounded, March 12, 1915, in the Argonne,
without losing consciousness. He was wounded at ten
o’clock at night and waited until the next day to walk to the
ambulance and was at this time able to see perfectly. Arriving
at the ambulance he lost consciousness. He was trephined
but remembers nothing about the trephining.</p>

<p>His memory grew better from his arrival at a hospital in
the rear in April. An attempt was made to remove the bullet
in May, 1915. Though the surgeon’s finger was pushed as
far as the tentorium the patient did not lose consciousness or
sight, but on leaving the operating room he fainted and, after
a few days of restlessness and delirium, he became completely
blind. There was a cerebral hernia difficult to reduce.
Vision became a little better and light and persons could be
distinguished at the time when he was retired. A month
after the operation there was a convulsive crisis beginning in
the left arm, affecting the legs and ending in unconsciousness.
Several similar crises occurred in August, sometimes with and
sometimes without loss of consciousness. Later these crises
began to be limited to the left side and then to be ushered in
by visual hallucinations. At home he was unable to care for,
clothe or feed himself. The crises became more frequent.
The visual hallucinations began to dominate.</p>

<p>This situation lasted to February, 1916, when the blindness
which had been increasing since the onset of the hallucinations
became complete. The crises now became less
frequent and intense. Headaches not severe were exaggerated
after seizures. The patient acted like a totally blind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
person and said that he had before him a uniform and constant
gray without any light or dark spots or any color.
Upon this background bizarre pictures, caricatures, disguised
persons, animals or nameless things appeared colorless
without relief, in silhouette, but highly suggestive of reality
to such a degree that at first, according to the patient, he had
made gestures to reach, or push aside these pictures. The
crises were Jacksonian.</p>

<p>Pallor, perspiration, shivering, irresponsiveness, clonic
spasms of left arm followed. The patient always had a
premonition permitting him to get into bed if he was sitting,
for example, in his chair. Sometimes there was a dizzy
sensation as if the body were being rotated to the left. This
sensation did not occur at the beginning of the seizure and
the patient fought against it, turning to the right. Sometimes
he felt as if he were sliding at great speed down an
inclined plane. Headaches and sleepiness followed, but there
was never any complete loss of consciousness of memory.</p>

<p>The eye grounds proved normal and all the photomotor
reflexes were normal, though there was no pupil reflex to pain.
The patient could write readily to dictation printed letters.
It would seem that these printed letters mean that he had
visual memories, as he traced the characters as if from a
design. Speech was monotonous with some stuttering; but
his speech had always been of this sort according to information.
He walked with difficulty, not merely on account of
his visual but on account of his equilibration disorders.
Outside of his seizures he always turned to the right and if
left to himself standing he turned to the right. If asked to
walk straight ahead, he always turned to the right. Silent
and uncommunicative, he was amiable and sometimes even
gay. He often had troublous dreams, sometimes seeing his
relatives. He said he could bring up in his mind the faces
of his relatives and even the appearance of the Salpêtrière.
Reflexes and sensations were normal. There was a traumatic
rupture of the tympanum. Lumbar puncture showed a slight
excess of albumin and 1.8 lymphocytes to the cubic millimeter.
The Mauser bullet was found by X-ray in the left
calcarine region with its base touching the median line, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
applied to the inner table of the skull about a centimeter
above the internal occipital protuberance pointing forward,
outward, and upward. He was treated on a salt free diet
with bromides. The seizures grew fewer and at the time of
report two months had elapsed with nothing but a slight
vertigo and frequent nightmares. Intellectually also the patient
had improved.</p>

<p>The case is one of cortical blindness. The seizures are
explained by the vicinity of the right Rolandic region to the
lesion. The rotatory vertigo is to be explained by the contact
of the Mauser bullet with the tentorium and vermis of
the cerebellum, which may also explain the difficulties in
orientation that occurred between the crises. The visual
hallucinations are doubtless due to lesion of the calcarine
region.</p>

<p>Tunisian theopath with mystical hallucinations; gun-shot

</div>

<h4><b>Case 106.</b> (<span class="smcap">Laignel-Lavastine and Courbon</span>, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A. ben S. was sent to Villejuif with the diagnosis: “depression,
feeling of impotence, discouragement,” having been
found on the public street. He was indifferent, almost completely
mute, and was at first considered not to understand
French. In a fortnight, however, he was talking freely and
was then found to be afflicted with hallucinations, melancholia,
and delusions, apparently following trauma to the skull.</p>

<p>A. ben S. might have been about thirty years old, and was
of a rich family, indigenous in Tunis, well educated in the
Koran and Arabic literature.</p>

<p>Upon examination, this Tunisian gunner showed contraction
of visual fields, poor color vision, and general hypalgesia.
During examination, the man seized the needle and plunged
it deeply under his skin, exclaiming that a prophet felt nothing
and that he could be cut into bits without feeling pain.</p>

<p>It seems that he had had divine visions from early childhood.
In his youth he had once gone to a mountain near his
home and talked with Mohammed and Allah. Of course,
Allah did not appear in human form, but he appeared like
a ball or a wheel of fire, slowly turning. Mohammed was a
tall man, with a long white beard, his eyes darting rays of
fire, and his forehead bearing a gleaming bright body. Allah
was heard talking to Mohammed. Orders were given concerning
the sun and stars. Subterranean treasures were
displayed, as well as Paradise full of yellow, blue, and green
houris, transparent, such that, when food was taken, it could
be seen going down their throats. Hell too was visible, and
the devil very tall and black, an eye behind and another on
top. There were also many genii&mdash;little men who climbed
over the Tunisian’s body. Sometimes in dreams, Allah
carried him to all countries of the earth. It was hard to tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
whether these effects were hallucinations or vivid imaginings.
The Tunisian had been wounded after several months of
service by two bullets in one day: the one causing an insignificant
lip-wound; the other entering the skull behind. After
several months the bullet had been extracted by trephining.</p>

<p>His further history was obscured by the fact that he wove
delusional elements into his story. He said, for example,
that he had been court-martialed, though there was no
evidence that this was a fact. It is probable that after his
wound the patient in a delirium felt that he was going to be
shot. The visual hallucinations were very interesting, being
Lilliputian. He would see three or four hundred Tunisian
gunners walking along, knee-high or taller. Sometimes they
all would stop and aim at him. He also showed micromegalopsia,
real objects changing their height under his eyes.
Both the Lilliputian hallucinations and the micromegalopsia
dated from the trauma to the skull. There was no change
whatever in the mystical delusions concerning Allah and
Mohammed. These he had before the trauma.</p>

<p>20 and 21, fine râles. Then all symptoms disappeared.</p>

<p>Recovery was predicted, but on January 28 it was observed
that the patient was untidy, made mistakes in dressing,
such as trying to put his legs into the armholes of his shirt,
and denied the most evident facts: His <i>képi</i> on his head, he
said it was not. Face drawn; skin yellow. Appearance of
asthenia. Deep depression and hebetude. At this time
the knee-jerks were exaggerated, pupils unequal, vermicular
tremor of tongue; the patient walked on a broad base with
tremulous legs suggesting contracture and weakness.</p>

<p>February 8, in a similar state the patient wandered about
his room, moving his bed and chairs about, answering questions
with an absent air. He had now been taught to be less
untidy.</p>

<p>March 5, stiff neck and Kernig’s sign were distinct. He
made believe he was on his farm. Ecchymosis of right upper
eyelid: he had fallen (his sheep had pushed him over!). The
improbability of this idea did not persuade him to think it
had not happened. He walked after the manner of a tabetic.</p>

<p>In April he became bedridden, unable to walk, with marked
stiffness and Kernig’s sign. He had at this time periods of
excitement in which he would tear the bedclothes. He was
invalided as demented.</p>

<p>Meningococcus meningitis.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 108.</b> (<span class="smcap">Eschbach and Lacaze</span>, November, 1915.)</h4>

<p>During his eleven months captivity at Grafenwöhr, Eschbach
and Lacaze had the opportunity of observing the case of
a soldier, 24, who sustained a shell-wound in the left lung and
was made prisoner August 20, 1914, at Chateau Salins. He
got well of his wound, but February 16, 1915, began to cry
out and was restless in the night. He was found on the straw
muttering words among which only the word, “Head, head,”
could be distinguished. He was irresponsive, possibly deaf.
Suddenly he had a convulsive crisis and whenever touched
he would have jactitations and cry out. Otherwise, he was
calm and stuporous. The pupils were widely dilated. In
short, he showed a mental confusion associated with paroxysmal
excitement due to cerebral and cutaneous hyperesthesia.
The first symptoms had occurred the morning before, when
he leaned his head against a wall and complained.</p>

<p>Lumbar puncture yielded intra- and extracellular meningococci.
The patient was isolated. In the afternoon he became
less agitated, kept his eyes closed, mumbled, repeated
gestures, would spit in his hands, rub his hands together, rub
his neck, shoulders and body, or else he would pass his hands
over his forehead and through his hair. Occasionally he
would seize the straw and draw it to him with all his strength.
Once when asked, “What is your name?” he said, “Not
true. Not true.” Hallucinations appeared to have been
added to the situation. The neck was a little stiff to forced
flexion. Temperature 37.8. Lumbar puncture under chloroform
anesthesia; antimeningococcus serum was injected.
Next day quieter; able to get up and walk. Slept, mumbled
less, was able to answer simple questions, desired to urinate
and finally succeeded.</p>

<p>February 19, no mental disorder. Headache and lassitude.
Neck stiff, Kernig’s sign marked. Lumbar puncture
yielded a fluid now puriform; antimeningococcus serum
injected. February 20, lifting the head produced opisthotonos.
Labial herpes. The fluid yielded, besides meningococci,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
also endothelial cells. Serum injected. February
21, fibrin in fluid; serum injected. February 22, no head
symptoms. Herpes more intense, involving also arms.
Tongue coated. Temperature 37.5, evening 38.3. February
23, meningococci and lymphocytes in fluid. February
24, left knee swollen. Serum injected; puncture fluid showed
meningococci and polynucleosis. Fluid from knee showed
polynuclear cells without organisms. February 25, patient
reached evening temperature of 39.5; serum injected. A
few meningococci, altered polynuclear leucocytes. February
26, patient rigid, tongue coated, serum injection. Rare
meningococci, degenerated polynuclear leucocytes. February
27, rigidity decreased, evening temperature 37.7. February
28, Kernig’s sign absent. Herpes dry. Serum injection.
Fluid clear; lymphocytes and polynuclear cells; no
meningococci. March 6, painful inguinal gland on the left
side. March 7, epididymitis left (mumps two years before,
with headache two weeks and double orchitis). March 9,
serum eruption. March 17, epididymitis practically absent.
Lymph node painful. Later data impossible to get, except
that there was apparently an arthritis of the hip and a sacral
decubitus with eventual recovery.</p>

<p>Shell-explosion: Meningitic syndrome, fourteen
months.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 109.</b> (<span class="smcap">Pitres and Marchand</span>, November, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A soldier sustained shell-shock at the distance of a meter
at Saint-Hilaire, September 26, 1915. He lost consciousness
and blood flowed from his ears. He arrived, September 28,
at the neurological center in Bordeaux in a semistupor,
knowing that he had been shocked and had lost consciousness.
He groaned, cried out, and kept stroking his head with his
right hand; lay on the right side; showed Kernig’s sign right,
ptosis, and stiff neck. Headache was increased on moving
and noises. Patient constantly asked for food, but refused
to drink. Lumbar puncture yielded a yellowish fluid, due
to laked blood. October 3, headache, ptosis, left internal
strabismus, temperature 38.5. October 4, lumbar puncture,
slightly blood-tinted fluid. October 5, improvement; gap
in memory for period since shock. No strabismus, ptosis
diminished, temperature normal, improvement continued.
Kernig’s sign and headache persisted. He lay doubled up
on the right side, eyes closed, right hand on pillow. Defense
movements on touching the neck or occipital region. The
condition of semistupor often passed off in the afternoon,
when he could talk, write or play cards. He had always
smoked, even at the beginning of his disease. Lumbar
puncture yielded a normal fluid December 12, 1915. He was
sent February 23, 1916, to a hospital in the country, but
came back May 9.</p>

<p>It seems that several days after transfer he had had an
attack of delirium in the night, having lost consciousness, and
tried continually to get up out of bed, saying that he wanted
to go to Verdun to fight. This spell lasted several hours and
on the days following came mutism, refusal of food, and a
state of stupor. Nutritive enemata were given. As he grew
better he sometimes ate a great deal, sometimes nothing,
even wanted poison from his family, and wrote to a comrade
that he wanted to commit suicide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>May 9, he was clearer, told of seeing the shell, which he
said he had not heard, nor did he know how he had gotten to
a hospital. His head and spine had hurt him ever since the
shock. He had had difficulty in urination for two days after
the shock. He could not remember the delirious attack in
the country hospital. He gave various data about his life,
but not fully. He refused to lie on the left side, or to walk,
because of pain. He could lift either leg from the bed, but
hardly both. There was an irregular coarse tremor of the
extremities. The right hand was weaker than the left;
there were no reflex disorders; no change in the eye grounds.
There was a patchy analgesia. May 26, stupor reappeared
as before, with semimutism. June, the patient presented
the appearance of a dementia praecox in stupor, with stereotyped
gestures and attitudes, without catatonia. The
patient was sent to a hospital for the insane at Cadillac.
November 9, 1916, he returned to the neurological center, as
mental and cerebral disorder had disappeared. There still
persisted a difficulty in remembering facts since the shock and
there was still a functional paresis of the legs.</p>

<p>Brain abscess in a syphilitic: Matutinal loss of

</div>

<h4><b>Case 110.</b> (<span class="smcap">Dumolard</span>, <span class="smcap">Rebierre</span>, <span class="smcap">Quellien</span>, 1916.)</h4>

<p>An unmarried subaltern officer, 30, entered an army neuropsychiatric
center, April 8, 1915, looking exhausted and bearing
a ticket “nervous asthenia, evacuated for neurological
examination.” He said he had had scarlet fever at ten;
strongly denied syphilis, of which he presented no trace;
had not been excessively alcoholic and had had no nervous
seizures. Detailed information showed that he had been a
normal child. He left his two years’ military service with
promotion and was a man of above the ordinary intelligence.</p>

<p>He was wounded in the right buttock with a shrapnel bullet
about the end of September, 1914. He went back to his
regiment two months later and had shared in a number of
actions up to the time of his evacuation. He said he had been
very tired for several weeks, and had finally been sent to the
physician. There were pains in the kidney region and in the
head, especially on the right side. The head felt empty.
He could not sleep, but did not dream. Ideas were not
distinct. Memory had become impaired. He could not
keep his accounts right, and was afraid something might go
wrong.</p>

<p>There was no pain or nervous or reflex disorder of any sort
except for the knee-jerks and Achilles jerks (see below).
A special examination proved complete normality of eyes.
There was a slight hesitation in words, but no dysarthria.
There was a slight tremor of the tongue and fingers.</p>

<p>As to the tendon reflexes, April 9, on waking, the knee-jerks
were absent, but later in the day gradually came in evidence
again. The Achilles jerks were also absent at first, but could
be obtained after a prolonged examination and after percussion
of the calf. In the afternoon, after exercise, the knee-jerks
and Achilles jerks were easily demonstrable. The left
Achilles jerk was always a little weaker than the right.
Massage brought these jerks out to virtual normality. April<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
10 and thereafter, similar findings; percussion of the muscular
masses of the thighs and calves always brought out the
reflexes.</p>

<p>Lumbar puncture yielded a clear fluid with hyperalbuminosis,
20 cells per c.mm. (lymphocytes and mononuclear cells 95
per cent) and a positive W. R. Iodide of mercury treatment
was given April 18.</p>

<p>April 23, the patient went into a coma, with trismus, stiff
neck, Kernig’s sign, sluggish pupils, incontinence. He was
transferred to a special hospital, showed on lumbar puncture,
April 23, 85 per cent polynuclear leucocytes, and died April
27. The autopsy showed a yellowish, quasidiffluent softening
of the size of a small egg in the first occipital gyrus on the right
side. The authors comment on the fact that the only objective
sign in this case was the variable tendon reflexes of the
lower extremities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span> “<i>l’unique cri de souffrance des centres

<h4><b>Case 111.</b> (<span class="smcap">Mendelssohn</span>, January, 1916.)</h4>

<p>Mendelssohn reports a soldier, who was sent to a Russian
hospital, April 12, 1915, with a diagnosis of chronic appendicitis.
Operated on next day, the patient appeared to be
passing through a normal convalescence, when ten days later,
he had an intense headache and some trouble in vision, which
disappeared the next day, only to be followed, two days later,
by the patient’s complaint that he could no longer urinate or
rise from bed.</p>

<p>In fact, Mendelssohn found a complete flaccid paraplegia
with urinary retention, without fever or pain. Knee-jerks
and Achilles jerks were absent, and there was a slight extension
of the great toe on plantar stimulation. There was
disorder of sensation, with heat sensibility abolished, painful
points poorly localized, and position sense poor. Electric
reactions normal. Pain on pressure in and about the lumbar
vertebral region. Cerebrospinal fluid showed lymphocytosis
and an excessive albuminosis.</p>

<p>This paraplegia lasted six weeks. At the end of May, the
patient began to be able to move his toes and to lift his heel.
Improvement was gradual and progressive. Early in June
he could walk if supported. The weak knee-jerk then began
to reappear and the urinary retention gradually disappeared.</p>

<p>This patient was not hysterical, although a bit emotional.
Perhaps, according to Mendelssohn, an organic lesion was
grafted on a neurosis. Perhaps the spinal lesion was infectious.
At any rate, a presumably organic paraplegia had
recovered in two months and a half.</p>

</div>

<h4><b>Case 112.</b> (<span class="smcap">Guillain and Barré</span>, August, 1917.)</h4>

<p>An infantryman, 20, came to the Sixth Army Neurological
Center, October 13, 1916, as a case of “choluria, due to shell
explosion; epistaxis needs watching.” He was somnolent,
had waked vomiting, pulse 108. Kernig’s sign, defensive
movements of the legs on stimulation, with flexion of leg on
thigh and of thigh on pelvis, plantar reflexes flexor. Puncture
showed typical meningeal hemorrhage. Two days later,
temperature 40, pulse 70, that is to say, a bradycardia in
proportion to the fever. Vomiting, pulse persisted. Next
day the patient was moaning and semi-delirious and showed
stiff neck, Kernig’s sign, accentuation of vasomotor disorder,
plantar response flexor with leg retracted, thigh flexion both
homolateral and contralateral. The spinal fluid upon the
next day, that is, four days after his arrival at the clinic,
showed a purulent fluid in which there was an excess of
albumin, no sugar, diplococci extracellular (proving on culture
to be pneumococci and able to kill a mouse in twenty-four
hours).</p>

<p>As a rule such hemorrhages remain aseptic, and in fact
meningeal hemorrhage is said by Guillain and Barré to have,
as a rule, a favorable prognosis. The above described case
was the only one of infected meningeal hemorrhage that had
occurred in the Sixth Army Neurological Center.</p>

<p>ANTEBELLUM cortex lesion: right hemiplegia;
recovery. Struck by shrapnel on right shoulder:
Athetosis.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 113.</b> (<span class="smcap">Batten</span>, January, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A British soldier, aged 27, showed a somewhat remarkable
phenomenon. It appears that at five years of age, this man
had had poliomyelitis, affecting the left leg. At 20 years of
age, he had had pneumonia, and this had been followed by a
paralysis of the right arm and leg with a loss of speech. The
man recovered from this illness, although he never quite
regained full control of the right hand. It is evident that
this lack of control was not marked, else the man would not
have been enlisted, and it is Dr. Batten’s opinion that at all
events he could not have shown pathological movements of
the right hand at the time of enlistment.</p>

<p>However this may be, in October, 1914, the soldier was
struck on the right shoulder with shrapnel. Apparently he
was not wounded, but thereafter he was not able to use the
right arm well, and in two months’ time he had become
unable to manipulate his rifle. On January 13, 1915, he was
sent home. The remnants of the old poliomyelitis of the left
leg were shown in a general weakness of that leg as compared
with the right. <i>The movements of the right hand were those
seen in athetosis.</i> The movements were independent of volition.
The patient had difficulty in releasing his grasp. He
improved rapidly during the six weeks he was in hospital,
although the movements of the right hand never became
entirely normal.</p>

<p>In this case, according to Batten,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span> “the stress was sufficient
to bring into prominence the symptoms due to an old cerebral
lesion.”</p>

<div class="chapter" id="case114">
<p>Hysterical versus thalamic hemianesthesia.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 114.</b> (<span class="smcap">Léri</span>, October, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A soldier, 40, had been suffering for a number of months
with pains in the left side of the trunk and feelings of weakness
in the left arm and leg. In the summer of 1915 he was on
leave and while walking, fell, lay down, and found he could
hardly move his left arm and leg. Two or three weeks later
he got up, walking with a stick. After some time in hospital,
he was sent back to the trenches, a little weak.</p>

<p>He had shortly, however, to be examined neurologically
again. He could hardly raise the left leg and his passive
resistance was poor on this side. The left side was almost
completely anesthetic to all forms of stimulus, although an
intense faradic current yielded a feeling like that of a fly.
Nor was the tactile sensation absolutely nil, as it could be
got with a flat finger on the upper arm and thigh. Cold and
heat sensations not well localized. The hemianesthesia was
sharply limited at the median line and affected the buccal,
lingual and nasal mucosa. Deep sensibility was almost
abolished on the left side. Stereognostic sense was lost and
the sense of position was lost absolutely for hand and foot.</p>

<p>The patient said that he heard less well on the left side.
There was also a slight contraction of the left visual field.
The reflexes were lively, but equal on both sides. A diagnosis
of hysterical hemianesthesia was apparently called for,
but psychoelectric treatment failed. The plantar reflex was,
in fact, completely absent on the left side, as well as the corneal
reflex. The faradic current failed to produce as marked
a dilatation of the pupil on the left side as on the right. The
forehead wrinkles were less marked on the left side. The
mouth deviated slightly to the right. The left nasolabial
fold was a little less marked. The tongue did not deviate,
but was a little narrow on the left side. The palate deviated
a little to the left. The left side of the trunk seemed a little
less developed than the right, and the scapula stuck a little
less closely to the body on the left side, when the arms were
raised. The left buttock was a little narrower than the right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
and the left gluteal fold was less marked. In combined
flexion of thigh and trunk the left foot readily left the floor.
There was a left-sided hypotonia in forced flexion of the forearm.
There were no tremors of the limbs in repose, except
a few contractions of the left lower extremity. In movement,
however, there was a marked tremor and in coördination the
finger to nose test could not be performed. Speech was slow
and hesitant, sometimes stuttering. Food was sometimes
taken into the air passages. Headaches were localized on
the right side. They had begun when the first symptoms
began. There was mental disorder, with gaps in memory.
In short, the case is probably one of thalamic disease, though
there were no pains except a few in the left side of the trunk
at the beginning of the disease. The diagnosis of hysteria
was at first made in this case, but the rule that hysterical
hemianesthesia is never found without auto- or hetero-suggestion
caused the alteration of diagnosis to thalamic.</p>

<p>Shell-explosion: Syndrome suggesting multiple

</div>

<h4><b>Case 115.</b> (<span class="smcap">Pitres and Marchand</span>, November, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A soldier, 40, carriage painter, underwent shell-shock at
Voquois, May 2, 1915, following ten hours’ bombardment.
At the time he felt tinglings. The bombardment had just
ceased when he fainted suddenly while repairing a telegraph
line. There was no loss of consciousness. He could not
move his arms or legs, was able to spit, and did not suffer at
all except for the tingling. He was evacuated to the interior,
where the diagnosis of psychopathic double paraplegia, Kernig’s
sign, zones of anesthesia in the legs, was made. He was
immediately treated with gray oil, and got an injection of
neosalvarsan, and iodides. He grew slowly better. He
could lift a leg from the bed, but then both legs began to
tremble. The arms had recovered their movement, before
the legs, but always trembled in movement.</p>

<p>November, 1915, he was able to get up; two months later,
he walked alone.</p>

<p>At the neurological center, which he entered December 17,
his gaze was fixed and there was a slight exophthalmos. The
folds of the face were smoothed out. The nose was deep set
(as a result of a fall at the age of eight). In the upright position
he could not remain still, but trembled markedly on the
left side, so that he had to make a few steps to keep his balance.
He was unable to stand on his left leg. He walked
on a broad base, in little steps, and rather unsteadily on
account of tremors augmenting upon movement. General
muscular weakness; left hand slightly weaker than right.
He could not lift both legs more than 20 cm. from the bed
and in the process they both trembled, trembling together.
There was also intention-tremor of the arms, a little less
marked than that of the legs, of an irregular rhythm. The
arms trembled as a whole. In a state of rest there was no
tremor. There was a slight muscular stiffness and the patient
himself felt difficulty in relaxing. Patellar reflexes absent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
even on reinforcement; Achilles jerks absent. Speech monotonous
and tremulous, but not scanning; syllable doubling
observed by the patient. Manuscript tremulous and, on
account of tremors, illegible. Hypalgesia of legs, more
marked distally. Deep sensibility of tendo Achillis and patellar
reflexes lost. Pain on compression of eyes diminished.
Formication in arms. W. R. of blood negative. Slow improvement
followed and the patient left the neurological
service May 4, 1916, able to walk more easily and without
tremor. The knee-jerks and Achilles jerks were still absent.</p>

<p>We here deal with a syndrome in part that of a multiple
sclerosis, that is, the intention-tremor, gait disturbance,
muscular rigidity, and weakness.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> multiple sclerosis, Lépine remarks that there are numerous
army cases of pseudo multiple sclerosis which are
actually hysterical or hystero-traumatic cases of hypertonus
and tremor. The true cases of multiple sclerosis, according
to Lépine, are of interest inasmuch as they are usually found
in officers. These men have apparently at first but a slight
motor disorder, quite compatible with desk work. We have
usually under-rated the cortical element in multiple sclerosis.
Spells of confusion, delusional ideas, sometimes grandiose,
start up without warning in these cases. To be sure, alcohol
and syphilis sometimes also enter these cases etiologically.
Any case of localized tremor ought to be carefully examined
psychically, and such cases in general ought not to be given
responsibility.</p>

<p>A soldier was blown up by a mine and rendered unconscious.
Upon recovery of consciousness, he was dumb,
unable to work, very nervous, paralyzed as to left arm and
leg. The paralysis improved so that in the hospital at home
the patient became able to get about. However, he threw
his legs about in an unusual fashion. Several months later,
the patient was much improved.</p>

<p>Shortly, however, there was a relapse. Transferred to a
hospital for chronic cases, the patient was unable to walk
without assistance on account of complete paralysis of the
leg. Insomnia, general tremor, and a bad stuttering developed,
with a habit of starting in terror at the slightest
noise.</p>

<p>Hypnotic treatment was followed by almost complete disappearance
of the tremor. The patient began to sleep six or
seven hours a night; nervousness diminished, and the stuttering
slowly improved; but neither the paralysis nor the anesthesia
of the left leg was affected by suggestion. The leg
remained cold, livid, anesthetic, and flaccidly paralyzed to
the hip. Though a slight improvement has since been produced
by faradization, the patient still can walk only with
assistance.</p>

<p>A man was injured in 1906 by the fall of a heavy weight on
his back. In 1914 he went to France as a soldier, and eight
months later was hurled into a shell hole so that his back
struck the edge. He was rendered unconscious. Upon
recovery of consciousness, the right leg was found to be
swollen, and there were severe pains in the legs and back.</p>

<p>Since return home the patient had gone from one hospital
to another, for the most part unable to walk, suffering from
agonizing pain in the head and eyes, unable to sleep, and in
the night subject to horrible waking dreams.</p>

<p>At first able only to bring himself to an upright position
and to rush a few steps, he later acquired considerable
control of his feet and legs through crutches. The insomnia
persisted.</p>

<p>Smyly regards this case, like <a href="#case116">Case 116</a>, as more neurological
than mental.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> organic neurology, much of great value has been reported.</p>

<p>Sargent and Holmes say that, contrary to expectation,
there have been few war cases of bad sequelae of cerebral
injuries, such as insanity and epilepsy. During early stages,
after infection of the head wounds, there is dulness and
amnesia, irritability and childishness,&mdash;symptoms which
disappear during and after repair of the wounds. Mental
disorder requiring internment is surprisingly rare. During
12 months only eight cases were transferred from the head
hospital in a year to the Napsbury war hospital, where cases
of insanity attributable to the service are sent; and in but
two of these could the persisting mental symptoms be attributed
to head injury.</p>

<p>Col. F. W. Mott confirms the opinion of Col. Sargent and
Col. Holmes, remarking that from all the London County
Council Asylums, only one case of insanity associated with
gunshot head wound had been admitted, and that this was
one of a Belgian who died from septic infection of the cerebral
ventricles. Yet all cases of insanity in invalided soldiers
belonging to the London County Council area (about one-seventh
of the population of the United Kingdom) are transferred
to these asylums.</p>

<p>Again Sargent and Holmes point out that both generalized
and Jacksonian epileptiform seizures are comparatively rare
in patients suffering from recent head wounds; even convulsions
in later stages have been as yet less common than was
feared. Thus, after evacuation to England, fits occurred in
37 (6 per cent) of 610 cases with complete notes, and in only
eleven of these 37 cases were the convulsions frequent.
Sargent and Holmes remark, however, that the practice of
giving bromides regularly to all serious cranial injuries until
the wound is healed, and for some months afterwards, seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
advisable. In 33 of the 37 convulsive cases there have been
severe compound fractures of the skull, and in four of these
a missile was still present in the brain. Five secondary
operations were performed with good results, after drainage
of small abscesses in two and removal of spicules of bone in
three. The In-patient and Out-patient records of the National
Hospital for the Paralyzed and Epileptic were searched
for epileptics already discharged from the army, but notes of
but two patients attending this hospital for epilepsy were
found.</p>

<p>As for other neurological complications aside from septic
infection and hernia formation, there are a few subjective
symptoms that may necessitate the invaliding of soldiers.
The most common of these is headache, usually in the form
of a feeling of weight, pressure, or throbbing in the head,
which headache is increased by noise, fatigue, exertion, or
emotion. Attacks of dizziness also occur, and nervousness
or deficient control over emotions and feelings. Changes of
temperament are found in some soldiers, who become depressed,
moody, irritable, or emotional, and unable to concentrate
attention.</p>

<p>Foix, under the direction of P. Marie, worked upon aphasia
in 100 cases, reporting results at a surgical and neurological
meeting, May 24, 1916, in Paris. Only lesions on the left
side of the brain have produced important and lasting speech
disorder, although lesions on the left side may leave behind
them a little dysarthria or difficulty in finding words in conversation.
It is, of course, hard to tell speech disorder from
stupor or clouding of consciousness. Foix notes certain
specialties in speech defect according to which region of the
left brain is affected.</p>

<p>First: Prefrontal lesions produce a transient dysarthria,
lasting but a few weeks, and right-sided prefrontal lesions
produce just as much disorder.</p>

<p>Occipital lesions produce no speech disorder.</p>

<p>Second: Patients with right-sided hemianopsia due to
lesions of occipital regions were not aphasic and could read
or write perfectly. Lesions of the left visual centers certainly
do not affect reading. If, however, the injury is not to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
visual centers, but is upon the lateral part of the occipital
lobe, then alexic phenomena appear, and these the more the
lesion approaches the temporal-parietal region.</p>

<p>Third: Central convolutional lesion produces a variety of
disorders according to the site and extent of the lesion.
There is no aphasia with the crural monoplegia due to
superior paracentral disorder. But slight aphasic disorder
accompanies the brachial monoplegia of middle central lesion,
though writing, reading, and calculation are slightly affected,
and the more so the more the lesion extends posteriorly to the
stereognostic regions. The lower down in the precentral
region the lesion appears, the more likely is the Broca syndrome
to be observed. But if the hemiplegia is chiefly a
brachial monoplegia, the aphasic disorder may remain slight,
involving reading, writing, understanding of words, the
spoken word, articulation, and calculation.</p>

<p>Fourth: Lesions of the lateral-frontal region produce more
or less marked aphasic disorder, just as do those of the inferior
part of the precentral gyrus. This aphasia is more apt
to occur when the wound is deep. However, no case of
permanent aphasia has been observed in cases of lesion of the
lateral-frontal region (termed in Foix’s nomenclature, the
precentral region, but referring to the tissues in front of the
precentral (or ascending frontal) gyrus of the more familiar
nomenclature). Almost absolute, or absolute, anarthria follows
the wound, and the patient is hemiplegic. This hemiplegia
may last from ten days to two or three months. After
a time there is no longer more than a slight dysarthria, and
writing becomes good again; reading remains, perhaps, a
little difficult. A complete or almost complete cure is the
rule.</p>

<p>Fifth: When the retrocentral region is injured, various
aphasic syndromes appear. The retrocentral region is the
parietal-temporal lobe except the superior part of the parietal
lobe and the anterior part of the temporal lobe, which latter
two regions when injured do not allow any marked aphasic
disorder. Lesions of the middle or posterior temporal region
are particularly important for speech, and produce more
marked disorder than lesions of the angular gyrus or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
supramarginal gyrus. At first, words cannot be spoken, for
a period of a fortnight to three months. Speech returns
progressively, with an increased power of comprehension.
At the same time, the patients begin to read and write. But
there is no further spontaneous progress after a period of
six or eight months, and then special reëducation must be
started. These speech disorders of retrocentral (parietal-temporal)
origin are either aphasic syndromes or slight
remains of psychical disorders, or again, a disorder practically
limited to alexia. The true aphasic syndromes concern the
spoken word, understanding the words, writing, and calculation.
The disorder is not especially dysarthric and consists
particularly in loss of vocabulary. It might be called an amnestic
aphasia (Pitres). These cases have well-marked intellectual
disorder and their power of calculation is especially
poor. As to the aphasic traces, which are more important
to understand than they are extensive in point of fact, they
relate particularly to calculating power, to vocabulary (slowness
in finding words), and to reading (reading without comprehension).
As to the cases of alexia, these are cases of
lesions of the posterior part of the parietal-temporal lobe, and
are usually accompanied by a hemi- or a quadrantanopsia.</p>

<p>To sum up, cases with central lesions (precentral and postcentral
gyrus) have hemiplegia and a Broca aphasia without
much tendency to cure. Cases with lesions anterior to the
central convolutions have a transient anarthria and their
recovery is ordinarily complete. Cases with retrocentral
lesions have an aphasia suggestive of Wernicke’s aphasia, and
ordinarily leave behind them extensive defects in intelligence
and language. These cases should be taken account of from
the standpoint of compensation, since they are much worse
off for work than many cases with amputations; and though
their disorder looks slight, it quite interferes with working at
a trade. From the point of view of military effectiveness,
the retrocentral cases are not very good soldiers, and especially
not good officers, as they do not understand commands
completely.</p>

<p>Neuropsychiatric phenomena in rabies.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 118.</b> (<span class="smcap">Grenier de Cardenal</span>, <span class="smcap">Legrand</span>, <span class="smcap">Benoit</span>,
September, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A farmer, 34, mobilized in veterinary work, fell sick at a
station for sick horses, April 25, 1917. He breakfasted well,
drank coffee, and went to the <i>abreuvoir</i> at eleven o’clock. He
told his mates that he felt bad in his head. He fainted over
a table at the eating house, refused to eat or drink. At noon
he went out into the court, vomited and went to lie down.
A physician thought he was suffering from angina because
of the pronounced dysphagia. He entered the hospital
at eleven o’clock at night on the 25th. He was found next
morning on his back, with a fixed and haggard look, crimson
face, masseter and phalangeal spasm at times. Respiration
irregular, interrupted by moans. The pulse would go up to
120 during agitation and then go down to 50 as soon as the
patient lay down again. Pupils slightly dilated and unequal.
As the patient came from a sick horse dépôt, the first question
was that of tetanus, suggested somewhat by the jactitation
of the limbs and the trismus. A violent headache began and
the patient cried out, “My head! My head!” Painful
vomiting movements, with very slight bilious material.
Convulsive movements increased. The pulse was slow. The
diagnosis “meningitis” was suggested, despite the absence of
fever and the absence of Kernig’s sign. Lumbar puncture
gave limpid fluid with a normal lymphocytosis, without increase
of albumin or reducing substance. The bacteriological
smear and culture were negative.</p>

<p>Soon another sort of symptoms appeared. The patient
would rise, cry out, threaten his neighbors. He was calmed
with morphine. There were periods of excitement alternating
with periods of calmness, during which he would reply sharply
but accurately, being somewhat vexed by the questions, and
would walk up and down without offering a word. When a
glass of water was offered to him, as soon as his glance met
the glass his eyes expressed fear. He drew back in repulsion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
and cried out in terror. When the liquid was out of his sight
the hydrophobic spasm ceased. This hyperesthesia of the
sensorium was so intense that the mere sight of the shining
glassware of the laboratory brought out a sharp crisis.</p>

<p>He was sent that evening to the neuropsychiatry center,
walking jerkily and as if slightly drunk, with a number of
small gesticulations and murmurings. He was immediately
isolated, undressed himself and went to bed. He did
not move in his bed, and seemed to sleep. The next day he
got up, dressed and had a small spell of excitement, but was
quiet enough on the medical visit, though the floor was soiled
with urine and vomitus and the clothing was in disorder.
He now had a pronounced phase, deep sunk eyes, drawn
features and anxious look; dilated pupils and an expression
of mixed fear and anger. His breathing was hard and he
kept his hand on his heart. He was oriented. He suddenly
rose and said, “I am thirsty.” A glass of milk was given
him. He hesitated a moment, plunged his mouth and hands
into it and aspirated the drink without making any swallowing
movements. He pushed away the glass, spat a little, and
vomited a small quantity of a black liquid. Then followed
an anxious crisis, and he fell upon his side, absolutely immobile,
without breathing for a few seconds. Again in the
sitting posture, he was taken with contractions of the limbs
and face. The tendon reflexes were at this time normal.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later the attendant found him dead,
in the sitting posture, leaning against the wall, mouth open,
arms dependent, hands extended, pupils dilated&mdash;a death
in syncope. The brain was found congested. There was a
slight effusion of blood over the posterior aspect of the brain.
There were no hemorrhages or softenings in the brain substance.
The muscles were of a dark red to black. The adherent
lungs were very slightly congested at the base. The
stomach contained a quarter of a liter of black, inodorous
fluid in which there was much bile and little blood. There
were numerous small hemorrhages of the mucosa near the
great curvature. The spleen was large, the liver congested.
The Pasteur Institute confirmed the diagnosis of rabies.
There is no history of the man’s having been bitten by a dog.</p>

<p>Tetanus: Psychosis.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 119.</b> (<span class="smcap">Lumière and Astier</span>, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A soldier wounded May 18, 1916, was given antitetanic
serum May 26th. The wounds healed, but on June 16, that
is, 29 days after the trauma, contractures began, at first localized.
There had been numerous wounds of legs and scrotum
by shell fragments and the contractures were limited to
the right leg and scrotum. There was no trismus or any
lumbar symptom.</p>

<p>During the next few days the contractures became general,
the temperature rose, a shell fragment was found by X-ray
at the root of the thigh and was surgically extracted. B.
tetani was found upon inoculation of media with material
from the shell fragment. Persulphide of soda and antitetanic
serum 90 cc. in three days were given intravenously.
The temperature fell and the general health was greatly improved.
July 6, hallucinations and terrors, worse at night,
set in. The man believed himself surrounded by flames,
that daggers were being plunged into his old wounds, that
his hair was being pulled. These symptoms lasted a fortnight
only, whereupon the patient recovered.</p>

<p>This case and six others accompanied by cerebral disturbances
all recovered, and all the patients retained a perfect
memory of their delirium and of their hallucinations.</p>

<p>The chronological distribution of these cases was odd.
One case was found early in the war; then no other cases of
cerebral disorder presented themselves until the group observed
at the end of 1916. Besides flames and daggers,
zoöpsia was several times observed. One of the cases showed
these symptoms without having been given antitetanic serum.</p>

<p>Tetanus fruste versus hysteria.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 120.</b> (<span class="smcap">Claude and Lhermitte</span>, 1915.)</h4>

<p>Claude and Lhermitte describe a condition of <i>tetanos
fruste</i>. The neck was absolutely rigid. The patient had
not been wounded in any way and, being regarded as a pure
neuropath, was sent to the Centre Neurologique at Bourges.</p>

<p>The differential diagnosis lay between true tetanus and the
hysterical pseudotetanus or pseudomeningitis. In pseudotetanus
there is a contracture of the superficial and deep
neck muscles, especially the trapezii, sternomastoid, and
deep muscles. The condition somewhat suggests that of
acute meningitis or tetanus, and especially suggests tetanus
because it is often associated with masseter contracture
(hysterical trismus). The head is immobile, stiff, and inclined
backward; eyes directed above, throat slightly prominent.
Upon attempts to move the head, intense pain occurs.
The pain and contracture sometimes even suggest a suboccipital
Pott’s disease. This form of hysterical pseudotetanus
is of sudden onset, as a rule following burial in a
trench or else contusion, or a slight wound in the cervical
region. Pressure on the spinous processes produces no pain,
nor does a blow upon the head; and an X-ray examination
will definitely eliminate the hypothesis of Pott’s disease.</p>

<p>To return to the Claude-Lhermitte case of limited true
tetanus: It showed marked modifications in the tendon and
bone reflexes. Upon percussion of the zygoma, of the occiput,
or of the clavicle, there was a marked further contraction in
the contractured muscles. Although there was no apparent
spasticity in the legs, there was an ankle clonus and a bilateral
patella clonus, combined with a distinct exaggeration of all
bone and tendon reflexes. In such cases also there is hyperexcitability
of the nerves and muscles to faradic and galvanic
currents.</p>

</div>

<h4><b>Case 121.</b> (<span class="smcap">Turrell</span>, January, 1917.)</h4>

<p>The following letter from an officer who had had local
tetanus and was treated by Turrell by ionization Dec. 6
and 7, 1915, by diathermia Dec. 7 to 22, and occasionally by
static breeze ionization and chlorine ion to relieve contractions
from Dec. 29, 1915, to Feb. 4, 1916. The tetanus was
in the muscles of the legs. Of course diathermia is a purely
symptomatic treatment and does not replace antitoxin serum
or other specific treatment; thus its effect in relieving the
contractions of local tetanus is precisely like its effect in the
treatment of sciatic neuritis or lumbago.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>November 15, 1916.</p>

<p>“Dear Major Turrell,</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
<p>“I have been meaning to write to you for some
time, as I knew you would be interested to hear how I
was getting on. Your letter has just been received, and
I am only too happy to give you any information I can
with regard to my leg. I was wounded in the left leg
on October 13, 1915, by high explosive shell, and arrived
at Oxford on October 22. There was no operation as
the surgeon in charge did not consider it advisable to
remove the pieces of shell: my leg seemed to be getting
better, and after about a month I was able to hobble
round with sticks. My foot at this time used to swell
a great deal towards night, and the foot seemed then
to gradually stiffen up with violent pains at intervals,
this gradually spread up the whole leg to about the
knee, and I was compelled to take to my bed again.
The pain at times was very bad, similar to a very bad
attack of cramps, and then my leg became rigid and
stiff, and at other times used to get horrible jumps and
it was impossible to keep it still, and whenever the doctor
or nurse looked at it it used to stiffen up at once.
The night seemed to be the worst, and consequently
I got very little sleep. I often had to get up in the
middle of the night on crutches to try and obtain
relief, my leg was so cramped and sore. It was about
this time that you first visited me and prescribed a
course of electric treatment for my leg, and I shall never
be able to thank you enough for the relief it gave me.
I cannot remember the names of the different treatments,
but the first one&mdash;diathermy, or heat pads&mdash;certainly
relieved the pain, and after the first two or
three visits to you I got immense relief. I never looked
back after this, and, although the progress was slow, I
gradually lost all pain and was able to get sleep at night.
The nervous jumps slowly disappeared and my leg
became gradually normal except for contraction of the
tendons. I was unable to straighten my ankle or knee,
and it was thought at one time that my tendo Achillis
would have to be severed. Gradually the knee straightened
and I was able to get my heel to the ground. I
was for some time on crutches, and was able to leave the
hospital on February 5, 1916, walking with sticks.…
I am now able to walk comfortably, but am unable to
flex the ankle more than at right angle to my leg. The
circulation is not very good, and I feel anything tight
round my calf. I am still getting Boards, and have not
been passed fit for overseas yet.”</p>

<h4><b>Case 122.</b> (<span class="smcap">Loewy</span>, November, 1915.)</h4>

<p>Out of a large number of dysentery patients, many of
whom had very serious symptoms, but one of Loewy’s
patients became psychotic. Loewy in fact had discharged
this one as normal, and he had been put on the wagon train
(no opium or alcohol) to go to a sanatorium. As the
fighting shifted, the sanatorium site changed and could not
be reached with the wagon. Finally, the wagon train met
the battalion once more and Loewy was told that the man
was “dying.” At this time he was afebrile, without collapse
symptoms, with a strong and normally frequent pulse, and
with few signs of exhaustion. Yet the guard had thought
that he looked moribund. Both upper eyelids were drawn
rigidly up but conveyed a different impression from that in
maniacal or anxious conditions. The expression was that
of staring astonishment, helplessness, and apathetic lack of
orientation. The patient recognized Loewy, spoke to him
as “Herr Doctor,” said he was doing quite well; he was
found to be well oriented. There was no fabricating tendency
even as to the number of stools (although Loewy had
noted such in bad dysenteries of the <i>Shiga-Kruse</i> type).
He was apparently hard of hearing, as if at the beginning
of a typhoid fever. He showed a retardation in his intake of
ideas, and his voice in answering sounded absent-minded.
There was an expression of absent-mindedness, and the
patient seemed markedly unconcerned about his health, the
direction of the journey, the terrible rain, etc. These phenomena
are attributed by Loewy to attention disorder.</p>

<p>The patient had been out of reach of fire for days. Loewy
reports the case as one of beginning amentia or as an exhausted
state resembling a Korsakow condition, recalling one
of emotional hyperesthetic weakness (Bonhoeffer).</p>

<p>Typhoid fever: Hysteria.</p>

<h4><b>Case 123.</b> (<span class="smcap">Sterz</span>, December, 1914.)</h4>

<p>A soldier entering hospital for typhoid fever, October 2,
1914, was discharged to another hospital and again, November
10, to a hospital for nervous disease. The typhoid was
serious and complicated by delirium. After defervescence,
the patient was weak and could not stand or walk, especially
on account of pains and weakness in the left leg. Sometimes
he had had pains in the sacrum and left hip. He complained
of tinnitus, deafness, dizziness, headache. He said he had
fallen from a cart, had been sick for three months, since which
time he had been under medical treatment for his present
condition. He had, he said, been given a small pension.</p>

<p>The gait disorder sometimes amounted to a real astasia-abasia.
The left leg became stiff and was dragged behind.
There was a paresis demonstrable in dorsal decubitus, of the
left side, especially of the leg, without atrophy. There was
a hypesthesia of the whole left side of the body, with the
exception of the head. Hyperesthesia of the left leg, hip
and upper sacrum. The left corneal reflex was diminished.
Moody, hypochondriacal, lachrymose. The general attitude
of the patient was affected and theatrical. Paradoxical
innervations were frequently found on test. There was no
neurological disorder except for the absence of the right
Achilles jerk.</p>

<p>The absence of this Achilles jerk may be regarded as a
residuum of the previous accident. The localization of the
pains points to a neurotic lumbosacral plexus disorder on the
left side. Superimposed upon this picture are the hysterical
phenomena. The typhoid fever and its attendant neuritis
are therefore to be interpreted as the liberating factor for a
severe hysteria in a subject already disposed to such symptoms
through previous accident.</p>

<p>A butcher, 29 (aunt insane, sister melancholy, one child
stillborn, deformed), had had several days convulsions at
eight; went through military service without incident; was
at the Marne and was evacuated October 19, 1914, with typhoid
fever,&mdash;a severe fever with a delirium prolonged into
the last weeks. Three months convalescent leave was given,
passed at Paris with the man’s aunt, but he had become
strange. One day he wanted to strangle neighbors of German
origin; another day departed for Dunkirk and then returned,
having lost all his documents.</p>

<p>February, 1915, he went back to the front, did strange
things and was soon evacuated to Tarascon. In April he
went back to his dépôt; May 18, to the hospital at Rennes
for erythema. June 15, he was given 15 days in prison
for setting off a cannon too quickly and then running off
through the fields. August 11, he was interned at Rennes
for stealing a priest’s cap. September 12, two months convalescence.
December 10, headaches. Back to Rennes January
14, February 18, Val-de-Grâce, then Maison Blanche.</p>

<p>Here he was found sometimes sad, immobile; at other
times laughing and singing. He was very irritable on small
occasion. Once on leave he had a fugue with complete
amnesia, though alcohol may account for the latter. His
memory was vague, especially for his crimes and for recent
events. He was emotional, indifferent even in the presence
of his wife or aunt. Sexual indifference. He often complained
of his head, saying that he felt it blocked and that he
could not think. The headache was frontal and would last
several hours. The man would, however, not complain
spontaneously. He was physically, in general, negative.</p>

<p>This case might possibly be due to a post-typhoidal encephalitis,
but Nordman believes rather that it is a case of dementia
praecox. Perhaps the convulsions at eight produced a slight
brain lesion, brought to an issue by the typhoid fever.</p>

</div>

<h4><b>Case 125.</b> (<span class="smcap">Merklen</span>, December, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A Breton farmer, 34, had paratyphoid alpha. Admitted
to hospital September 3, 1915, he had headache, anorexia,
asthenia, coated tongue and tense abdomen, algosuria; later,
abdominal swelling, borborygmi in the right iliac fossa, rose
spots, dicrotism, albuminuria, bronchitic rales. The disease
was severe, and was complicated by sacral decubitus and
ran a month.</p>

<p>At first somnolent, September 8th the patient went into a
state of mental excitement with agitation and delirium. He
got out of bed, cried out, sang, talked to his neighbors, complained
that his papers (colis) had been stolen, as well as his
watch and tobacco; that his horses’ hoofs had been injured,
and the like.</p>

<p>He grew calmer in a few days, and now no longer tried to
get up, remaining inert in his bed. The occupation delirium
persisted&mdash;he was not being paid what he owed, and the
like. He had hallucinations; looked for scissors, and one day
said, “Here they are!” At intervals he appeared lucid and
responded appropriately to questions.</p>

<p>The fever dropped and the paratyphoid disease appeared
past, but the mental state remained for three weeks without
change, having the same periods of lucidity when he would be
regarded as cured, but falling again forthwith into his post
oniric ideas. He was soon sent to a convalescent hospital
and was not wholly well for another month.</p>

<p>Psychopathic taint brought out by paratyphoid fever.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 126.</b> (<span class="smcap">Merklen</span>, December, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A soldier, 31, was a victim of paratyphoid alpha, entering
hospital October 21, 1915, with the usual symptomatology:
fever, asthenia, headache, abdominal swelling, tongue coated
and red along its edges, diarrhoea. After admission he
passed into a deep toxic state.</p>

<p>He woke up in the night with a cry, got up afraid, and refused
to go back into his own bed. He was mute, except for
curses addressed to the nurses. After two hours he went to
bed and to sleep. Next day he sat quietly with a depressed
look, occasionally groaning deeply, talking in brief phrases
about his anxiety, wanting his wife telephoned to, saying
that he would not see his children, was going into the four
planks, and the like.</p>

<p>This situation lasted about a week. He became afraid of
medicines and thought he had been poisoned, saying that he
would rather be shot than poisoned and complaining that,
though he had served France for fourteen months, they now
wanted to kill him. In the night time he was agitated. He
gave vent to cries, and threats, but this delirious state rapidly
decreased and he became calm the night of September 27th.
The upper extremities showed a tendency to catatonia.
From this time forth, during the remaining month, the patient
was immobile, mute, fearful, and mistrusting, depressed
and always wore a cunning look. His disorientation decreased
and he passed good nights. He would answer
questions by groaning. He would say, “They think I am
a Tartar.” The end of the mental disorder coincided with
the cure of the paratyphoid fever. According to Merklen,
the paratyphoid bacillus in these cases serves to bring out
a psychopathic taint. This particular patient had always
been of a sad demeanor, uncommunicative, very impressionable
and emotional. Two other cases had always been somewhat
below normal.</p>

<h4><b>Case 127.</b> (<span class="smcap">Marchand</span>, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A farmer, 37, was evacuated March 20, 1916, for diphtheria.
April 1, paralysis of tongue and uvula, impairment of vision.
These symptoms rapidly improved, but paralysis of the legs
appeared and then of the arms. This paralysis lasted until
he was sent to the neurological center June 28 for post-diphtheritic
paralysis, wherein it was found that voluntary movements
of the legs could be performed, though painfully and
of slight extent, that walking was impossible, that there was a
considerable atrophy of legs and arms, that the knee-jerks,
Achilles jerks and plantar reflexes were absent. There was
complaint of pains in the legs and over nerve trunks.</p>

<p>Improvement followed, the atrophy gradually passed away,
and the voluntary movements of the legs became more extensive;
but by October the reflexes had not yet reappeared.
Yet the patient had begun to walk on crutches and soon was
able to get on with canes only. The improvement did not
continue. He did not raise his heels and dragged his toes.
There was now a clonic tremor of the legs as soon as the
weight of the body was put on them. During movements of
legs carried on in dorsal decubitus there was found an irregular
tremor of the legs with twisting of the trunk. The
muscular strength was well preserved. There was a slight
muscular atrophy. The tendon reflexes had now come back,
though the right Achilles jerk was weak and the plantar
reflexes were absent. There was a hypalgesia of the legs
which ceased sharply at the middle of the thighs. There
was a slight hypoacusia on the left side. Visual fields normal.
The patient complained of feelings in the inside of his
bones. Electrical reactions normal.</p>

<h4><b>Case 128.</b> (<span class="smcap">Marchand</span>, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A soldier, 24, was evacuated June 24, 1915, from Roussy
for diphtheria and was treated by serum, receiving 80 cc.
in 8 injections. A few days later there was a paralysis of
the uvula with regurgitation of liquids from the nose; but
patient was able to go on convalescence July 21. A few days
later, however, he noticed that his legs were weak. Vertigo,
vomiting and painful walking followed, and his convalescence
was increased a month. The paralysis got progressively
worse. September 10, he went by automobile to Libourne
where he stayed two months. He arrived at the Neurological
Center at Bordeaux November 9 with diagnosis “polyneuritis
of legs.” He could not walk and could hardly flex thighs on
pelvis or legs on thighs. Voluntary movements of extension
and flexion of feet and toes were limited. There was neither
atrophy, pain nor reflex disorder. Both legs were analgesic,
as was also the abdomen up to the umbilicus. There was
complaint of dorsolumbar pains and of stomach trouble and
lack of appetite; vomiting after meals frequent, pulse 120.</p>

<p>January 3, the patient was able to lift his legs a few centimeters
above the bed but not together. There was now a
slight muscular atrophy especially on the left side. Knee-jerks
lively, analgesia limited to legs, no vomiting, pulse rapid.</p>

<p>The patient was sent to a hospital in the country May 8
to July 8. He was now much better. His legs were able
to support his body but he could not walk. Slight atrophy
of left leg. There was hypalgesia now in the feet and legs
below the knee. There was no pain on pressure over the
nerve trunks. The electric reactions normal. The patient
could now walk on crutches. He was invalided on the
temporary basis, December 12, 1916.</p>

<p>It does not appear that in this case the hysterical paralysis
was preceded by polyneuritis.</p>

<p>Malaria: Amnesia.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 129.</b> (<span class="smcap">De Brun</span>, November, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A soldier lost all memory of his hospital stay in Salonica and
the voyage home. He could only remember a little about
the hospital at Bandol. There is a period of transition to full
memory in malarial cases characterized by sure memory,
vague on certain points, alternating with phases of almost
complete amnesia. The soldier in question had very inexact
memories of the Bandol Hospital, and could only remember
about his fevers, that they began about noon and terminated
about four o’clock. Twice he had been found in his
shirt, walking, unconscious, in the passageway of the hospital.
Having obtained leave for convalescence, three months after
his memory gap began, he went to Paris, and probably had
attacks at home. He vaguely remembered afterward being
carried by automobile to the Pasteur Hospital, December 1.
There he remained to the end of March, 1917, without
preserving anything but the vaguest memories of an intermediary
period of more than six months. The memory in
these malarial cases often remains permanently altered and
there may even be a retrograde amnesia, carrying back to
facts prior to the gap and an anterograde amnesia relative to
facts after the main gap.</p>

<p>Thus, there is in the febrile period a retrograde amnesia
and in the post-febrile period a retrograde or anterograde
amnesia. One group of subjects are severe cerebral cases,
and the memory gap appears to run back to a period of true
mental confusion. But there is another group of patients who
preserve throughout the febrile period an absolute consciousness
of all acts, and yet the memory gap is just as sharp
and definite as in the confusional cases.</p>

<p>Malaria: Korsakow syndrome.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 130.</b> (<span class="smcap">Carlill</span>, April, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A stoker, 45, was admitted to the Royal Naval Hospital,
Haslar, November 6, 1916, from the Fifteenth General Hospital
in Alexandria, to which he had come from a hospital
in Bombay about three weeks before. At Alexandria he was
anemic and showed an edema of legs which had been present
for six weeks. Cylindruria; no albuminuria. At Haslar
there was no cylindruria and no edema, and nothing but
weakness, gouty arthritis of left wrist, right ear and left
great toe. Red cells 4,650,000, leucocytes 10,000 (52 per
cent polymorphonuclear, 46 per cent lymphocytes). He was
rather dull mentally. December 10th, Dr. Fildes found
malarial organisms in the blood on the occasion of a hyperpyrexia
(104°). Quinine was given. December 14th, he was
transferred neurological. According to the patient’s own
story, he was born June 10, 1868, lived in Fulham, had a
daughter aged 12 years, had recently seen his wife at the
hospital: all this seemed plausible enough.</p>

<p>Later, however, he said that the year was 1899, that King
Edward was king, that the war was between England and
some field forces, etc. This well-nourished, pale, simple-looking
stoker spoke quietly and politely; told about intermittent
fever; about being eight years on the active list,
becoming a reservist and being called up for the war. He
read intelligently, could do sums, but did not know the name
of the hospital and was confused about the war. He recognized
that his memory was not as it should be; constantly
stroked his moustache and chin. He was happy and contented.</p>

<p>The gait was normal, systolic blood pressure 140 mm.;
no evidence of alcoholism. Blood, January 15, 1917, contained
5,050,000 reds, 10,300 leucocytes (63 per cent polymorphonuclear,
37 per cent lymphocytes). There was a
bilateral absence of the ankle-jerks, repeatedly confirmed at
subsequent examinations. Wassermann reaction was negative.
Puncture fluid contained no cells.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>Instead of living at Fulham, this stoker lived at Portsmouth,
and had not been seen by his wife for four years. He
had done 18 years’ active service and had last sent his wife a
letter from the Sailors’ Home at Bombay, November, 1916.
They had been married 21 years. He caused astonishment
with his wife and friends by announcing that Lord Roberts
and General Buller were in command at the battle of the
Falklands. He continued to say that he lived at Fulham.
He was discharged home, January 22. It seems as if he
were living through the period of the Boer war.</p>

<p>Carlill considers that alcoholism may be ruled out, and
there is no likelihood that the gout was the cause of the
neuritis. He believes that the neuritis was probably malarial.
Possibly the illness suffered in Bombay may have been
beriberi or it may have been malarial nephritis.</p>

<p>A complication of malaria.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 131.</b> (<span class="smcap">Blin</span>, August, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A Senegalese corporal of machine gunners, 21 (early life
normal save for sore throats and coughing), was a robust,
well-developed man of 75 kilos when he entered the hospital
at Konakry, February 15, 1916. He was given the diagnosis:
malarial anterior spinal paralysis.</p>

<p>It seems that he had joined a Colonial regiment, April 8,
1915, attended classes as a recruit, left Bordeaux November
1 for Dakar, arriving there November 11. He stayed there
some sixteen days, during which time he slept without mosquito-netting.
November 16, he left for Konakry, and had
his first febrile symptoms November 27, with vomiting,
headache, and prostration. His temperature ran as high as
41, but by December had fallen to normal, after quinine.</p>

<p>The corporal was sent away, cured, to his company at
Kouronesa, December 6. There was more fever, headache,
and vomiting during the railway trip. Quinine again relieved
the fever, but a bloody diarrhoea set in so that it was only
at the end of January that he could go on service.</p>

<p>February 6, another attack of fever, with shivering and
perspiration, lasted for some three hours. He could hardly
stand by himself and had to be helped in walking. Next
day, another spell of three hours of fever; definite paralysis
set in, affecting both legs. February 8 the arms were attacked
by paralysis which, unlike that of the legs, was a
progressive one, attacking first the shoulders, then the elbows,
the wrists, and finally the hands. All the body muscles were
in a state of flaccid paralysis, as well as the muscles of the
face. The patient was now afebrile. February 9 there was
a slight speech defect; the tongue was slightly paralyzed,
and swallowing became painful. The jaw movements remained
normal. The muscles of the face were intact and
the patient could whistle, move his lips, and move his eyeballs
normally. Vision normal. The pupils were fixed in
dilatation, more widely on the left side. There was a slight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
contracture of the vesical sphincter, necessitating the catheter.
The tendon and cutaneous reflexes were lost.</p>

<p>By February 14, when the patient was sent to the Bellay
Hospital, muscular atrophy had made its appearance. No
plasmodia could now be found in the blood, which showed
71 per cent polynuclear leukocytes, 20 per cent mononuclears,
9 per cent lymphocytes.</p>

<p>This state lasted til February 25. Despite the fact that
the patient ate well, emaciation rapidly progressed. The
buttock showed a very few signs of decubitus. Upon this
date there was pain from a marked orchitis of the left side,
the cause for which remains unknown (no history of gonorrhœa;
catheter used for the last time, February 15).
The temperature which attended the orchitis came down in
three days; the patient’s appetite was singularly good, but
the muscular atrophy increased. The speech defect meantime
disappeared, and the patient swallowed more readily.</p>

<p>March 7 a slight and hardly perceptible movement could
be noted in the fingers of the left hand. Two days later,
similar movements appeared in the right. March 11 he
could spread his fingers in a kind of creeping movement.
Next day slight movements were possible with the legs, and
March 13 the knees were movable. March 14 the patient
could lift his head from the pillow. The range of movement
now increased all over the body. According to the patient,
those parts were the first to regain power that had been attacked
last. This certainly seemed to be the case with respect
to the left upper limb, in which first the hand and
wrist, then the elbow and shoulder, successively recovered
power. The legs regained their power in the same way
proximad. March 17 the patient could sit up and grasp
objects with the left hand. The cremaster and plantar reflexes
appeared,&mdash;the former, more on the right; the latter,
more on the left. The left pupil remained in wider dilatation
than the right.</p>

<p>The treatment was by quinin and potassium iodide, with
massage. The patient was apparently on the highroad to
complete recovery, and left for France March 21, weighing
63 kilos.</p>

</div>

<h4><b>Case 132.</b> (<span class="smcap">Cottet</span>, September, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A fantassin, 36, carpenter by trade, went into the trenches
October, 1914, and had two attacks of trench-foot, first in
January, 1915, when there was a painful swelling of the foot
and secondly in July, 1916, when there were some bullae on
the dorsal aspect of the feet. These were not serious and
the fantassin did not report sick.</p>

<p>He was wounded, August 27, 1916, by shell fragment on the
right elbow, was evacuated to the ambulance where the
fragment was extracted and then to a hospital which he
left cured with a seven days’ leave. Although he had not
suffered in any way from his feet while in hospital, and had
not been exposed to cold, the bullae reappeared on the feet
just as they had been in July. They in fact now formed a
sort of exanthem occupying symmetrically the dorsal surfaces
of the toes. The bullae contained serum. They were
confluent, varying from pin head to a nut in size, were as a rule
round, but sometimes irregular. The eruption went on to a
cure rapidly and on the twelfth day the bullae had dried up.
This patient had hypesthesia up to the knees, hypesthesia
of the dorsal surfaces of the feet, hyperesthesia of the plantar
surfaces and ankles, hypesthesia of the forearm and the
elbow and of the dorsal surfaces of the hands with possibly
exaggerated sensibility of the palma surfaces. Hypesthesia
of the face was limited to a small part of the right ear.
The reflexes were normal and there was no atrophy. The
name “paresthetic trench acrotrophodynia” was given to it.</p>

<p>In a service of eighty beds Cottet found within two months
fifteen instances of these acroparesthetic disorders regarded
as neuritic changes in trench-foot of a latent and lasting
character which would have remained unobserved unless
there were disorders of sensibility. In fact similar disorders
of sensibility may be found without any history of <i>gelure des
pieds</i>, forming a latent type of neuritic alteration hardly
noticed by the patient himself. In twenty-six cases Cottet
found sixteen with hypesthesia of the ears and of the nose.</p>

<h4><b>Case 133.</b> (<span class="smcap">Roussy</span>, June, 1916.)</h4>

<p>As to the development of eschars, Roussy reports the
case of a lieutenant wounded September 25, 1915. There
was a penetrating wound of the interscapular region. The
bullet had entered on the posterior aspect of the right scapular
region and had emerged at the level of the first dorsal
vertebra. October 1, a neurological examination showed
flaccid paraplegia, knee-jerks normal, Achilles jerk weak on
the right, plantar reflexes flexor, cremasteric reflex absent on
the right, and both abdominal reflexes absent. There were
pains in the legs and arms. There was retention of urine
with overflow. A slight dulness on the right; temperature
from 38 to 39 degrees.</p>

<p>Four weeks later the knee-jerks had become very weak,
and the Achilles jerks were now absent. There was an extensive
diffuse atrophy of the lower leg and thigh muscles,
and a hypesthesia of pronounced degree had developed
throughout the legs, over the buttocks, and in the lumbar
region. Anal and vesical sphincters relaxed; dejections voluminous;
sacral decubitus as well as healed eschars. December
5, the patient was transferred to the Army neurological
center; temperature rose; there was much expectoration;
paracentesis yielded no fluid; pneumococcus in the sputum.
Cystitis had developed despite extreme care. Extensive
edema of the legs developed. There was increased dulness
on the right side, coughing and dyspnea. Death, January
17.</p>

<p>The autopsy showed a bronchial pneumonia of the right
lower lobe, confluent, imitating a lobar pneumonia. The
left lung also showed extensive confluent bronchopneumonia
at the base as well as disseminated areas and edema of the
middle and apical portions. Infectious splenitis, large fatty
liver, swollen kidneys, no pyonephritis.</p>

<p>The spinous processes of the 6th and 7th cervical vertebrae<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
were injured. There was no obvious gross disease within
the theca except that there was a slight adhesion between
the dura mater and the anterior surface of the spinal cord at
the level of the 7th cervical and highest dorsal vertebrae.
There was, however, a depression on the anterior surface of
the spinal cord at a lower level, namely, at the level of the
4th dorsal vertebra. Microscopic examination showed myelomalacia
with small cavities in the 1st and 4th dorsal segments,
suggesting the <i>état criblé</i>.</p>

<p>According to Roussy, these patients injured in the spinal
region are particularly sensitive to cold and support transfer
badly even when the disease is short. Such patients should
be evacuated to the interior after the shortest delay possible.
Sometimes these patients show rib fractures; these
are in the posterior portions of the ribs and are due to the
fall of the man when struck. It might be possible even that
the spinal lesions should through the action of the sympathetic
nervous system favor lung infection.</p>

<h4><b>Case 134.</b> (<span class="smcap">Heitz</span>, May, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A soldier, 32, was bowled over in a first-line trench by the
bursting of a shell that he did not see coming, September 14,
1914. He regained consciousness only in the middle of the
night, finding himself half covered with water. He was
taken up by the stretcher-bearers at eleven in the morning.
Paralysis in the legs was then absolute. There were pains
in the legs and in the back, but there was no evident lesion.
Knee-jerks, plantar reflexes, and abdominal reflexes absent;
cremasteric reflex absent on the left, weak on the right.
Tactile sensations, on the contrary, were almost intact except
for a slight diminution over the feet and the external
aspects of the lower legs. Sensitiveness to pin-prick, however,
was abolished throughout both lower extremities, and
diminished in the abdomen and back up to two or three
centimeters above the level of the umbilicus; that is, including
the territory of the first lumbar and the last three
dorsal roots. Sensibility to heat was abolished in the feet,
the external aspect of the lower legs, and the posterior aspect
of the thighs, but was preserved in the second and
third lumbar territory, in the anterior aspect of the thighs,
as well as in the region below the umbilicus. Micturition
was impossible. Constipation the first few days yielded
spontaneously September 20. There were signs in the bases
of both lungs, corresponding with a suffocating feeling. September
22, he was evacuated, almost well, without signs
of pulmonary congestion, having regained the power of urination
and some capacity to move the legs sidewise. February,
1915, after evacuation to a hospital at Vic, he showed
sacral decubitus, soon reaching the size of a hand, as well
as trochanteric decubitus; traces of albumin in the urine,
sacral and sciatic pains (recalcitrant to morphine).</p>

<p>He began to improve December 25. Camphorated oil
and the sitting posture relieved the pulmonary congestion;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
the temperature, which had oscillated round 38 degrees, fell;
the decubitus scarred over; the knee-jerks reappeared to
some extent, and movements began. February 5, the patient
had become able to walk without crutches. There was
still a two-franc sized area of decubitus over the sacrum, and
still a little spinal pain in walking.</p>

<p>It is difficult to consider this case only functional in view
of the decubitus, to say nothing of the radicular distribution
of the sensory disorder. Heitz brings this and the previously
given case (<a href="#case1">No. 1</a>) into relation with Elliot’s case of transient

windage of a bullet. He had not lost consciousness. Under
observation at his station, he got typhoid fever, and was cared
for at Paris from the beginning of October. About October
15 he began to feel pains in his left shoulder, neck, and arm.
The diagnosis, neuritis, was made and was strongly borne in
upon the patient, so that upon the cure of his typhoid, he
went out on two months’ leave with a complete impotence
and much pain of the left arm. At the end of his relief, he
was evacuated to Villejuif. January 24, it was found that
he had no somatic phenomena whatever, despite the fact that
the left arm and a part of the forearm was powerless, and so
painful that the patient cried out when his arm was moved.
There were a few cracklings in the scapulo-humeral joint.</p>

<p>Hot air and reëducation cured the man in less than two
months (March 20), though the disorder had lasted for four
months. The patient had been retired for hysteria before
the war and had re-enlisted.</p>

<p>Bullet wound of pleura: Reflex hemiplegia and
double ulnar syndrome.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 136.</b> (<span class="smcap">Phocas and Gutmann</span>, May, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A soldier, 26, was wounded in the enfilading of an Argonne
trench December 17, 1914. He felt the bullet like an electrical
shock, and fell. He had been leaning forward at the
time and suddenly felt the left half of his body go paralyzed
and his mouth pulled to one side. He did not lose consciousness,
and spat up a good deal of blood five minutes after
falling. He lay in the trench all night, unable to move his
left leg except by the aid of his right. He was evacuated next
day. There was a five-franc piece wound at the upper border
of the left scapula, four finger-breadths from the median
line. There were a few lung signs which rapidly cleared up.
December 28, the hemiplegia was better, although neurological
examination showed weakness of left upper extremity,
abolition of deep reflexes, and certain skin changes of the
left hand with edema (<i>main succulent</i>), decreased resistance
of muscles of lower extremity to passive motion, especially
of adductors and flexors, exaggerated polykinetic left knee-jerk,
ankle clonus, Babinski reflex, abdominal and cremasteric
reflexes absent on left, platysma paralysis left, with
complete paralysis in the inferior distribution of the facialis;
whistling impossible. Also the left eye could not be closed
singly. Synergic movements of the lower part of the paralyzed
face when the right hand of the patient was grasped.</p>

<p>There were also sensorimotor disorders in the ulnar distribution
on both sides, with complete anesthesia to pin
prick. There was also an area of hyperesthesia of the
anterior and postero-internal aspect of the right forearm
from below the elbow to the wrist. The tendon reflexes
were weak but distinct on the right side. The left arm had
feelings of pain, with <i>élancements</i> and formication from the
shoulder to the fingers on the ulnar distribution. There was,
of course, also, local hyperesthesia due to the wound of the
thorax.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>Lumbar puncture showed a fluid normal in all respects.
We deal with a hemiplegia of organic nature, associated with
the bilateral ulnar syndrome. The hemiplegia followed the
trauma immediately. When the ulnar phenomena appeared
is unknown.</p>

<p>The lung complications cleared. The pains disappeared;
motion returned up to the level of the facialis. The patient
got up and three months later went on convalescence, still
presenting Babinski, exaggerated knee-jerk and weak arm
reflexes on the left side. The bilateral ulnar syndrome had
disappeared six weeks after the patient entered hospital.
Phocas and Gutmann cite a considerable literature on nerve
complications of pleural trauma, among them syncopes of
grave prognosis; a relatively frequent pleural epilepsy (forty-five
per cent fatal) or epileptic status (seventy per cent
fatal); and the rare hemiplegia. Accidents and death have
followed exploratory puncture of the pleura. Air embolism
is probably not the cause. Phocas and Gutmann prefer
the theory of a reflex disorder starting from the pleura.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="case137">
<p>Hysterical tachypnoea.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 137.</b> (<span class="smcap">Gaillard</span>, December, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A man, 23, came to the Lariboisière November 29, 1915,
in a hurry to show evidence that he had been invalided for
valvular lesion of the heart. In point of fact, the interne
found a murmur at the base. Yet there were things in the
military papers suggesting caution. The patient next morning
showed no malaise, dyspnoea, or any evidence of serious
disorder. The contractions of the thorax beat in time with
contractions of the alae of the nose, about 112 per minute.
Here, then, was a cardiopulmonary patient. The heart impulse
was exaggerated; the patient could not or would not
stop breathing to aid the auscultation, but almost absolutely
normal sounds could be heard at the apex and the base. A
valvular lesion could be excluded. The lungs were perfectly
normal. The patient was requested to stop his gymnastics,
which might have succeeded elsewhere but could not at the
Lariboisière!</p>

<p>How could the man have established the synchronism of
pulse and respiration and synchronous tachypnoea and tachycardia?
Why should he persist in this form of sport, since
he had already been invalided? The family history was not
especially suggestive (father albuminuric, died at 59; mother
well, probably tuberculous). Scarlet fever at eight; occupation,
tourneur. After four months of service there was
gastric disorder followed by typhoid fever (despite vaccination,
according to the patient). Convalescent leave at Paris,
during which leave he had swollen legs and albuminuria.
May, 1915, gastric difficulty; valvular lesion determined;
examination; invalided. At home, a variety of complaints,
for which treatment was unsuccessful.</p>

<p>During further examination it was noted that in auscultation
the head of the examiner was lifted, as if there were
hypertrophy of the heart or an aortic aneurysm. The synchronism
was less exact on December 2; 112 beats to 128
respiration. Was this man a simulator? Had he become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
the victim of his own enterprise? There was no evidence of
simulation. It was a question of a monosymptomatic hysteria.
Gaillard discontinued the <i>manière forte</i> and undertook
a softer treatment, but the <i>manière forte</i> had caused the
family to want to take him away. Perhaps they feared a
too efficacious treatment. He then escaped observation.
It is probable that the tachypnoea ceased during sleep. It
was not so marked after the medical visit was over.</p>

<p>Soldier’s heart.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 138.</b> (<span class="smcap">Parkinson</span>, July, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A corporal, 21, who had been a miner and entirely well up
to enlistment in August, 1914, went to France in 1915. In
June, came shortness of breath and palpitation on exertion;
later, precordial pain (fifth space, between nipple and median
line) and giddiness on walking. Like all cases of true so-called
“soldier’s heart,” this soldier had no physical signs
indicative of heart disease, yet reported sick for cardiac
symptoms on exertion. In this particular case, as in about
half of forty cases reported by Parkinson, there had been
no disability in civil life.</p>

<p>August, 1915, the soldier was admitted to the casualty
clearing station, where the apex beat was found in fifth
intercostal space internal to the left nipple line. The first
sound was duplicated in all areas. The second sound was
duplicated, though not loudly, at the base. After nine
months’ treatment, this man went back to light duty with
slight symptoms.</p>

<p>According to Parkinson, the absence of abnormal physical
signs in the heart of a soldier should not prevent his discharge
from the army if under training or on active service
he shows breathlessness and precordial pain whenever he
undergoes exertion well borne by his fellows. A simple
exertion test, such as climbing 25 to 50 steps, reproduces the
symptoms in such a patient. The rate of the heart at rest
is a little higher than that of normal men, though the increase
on exertion is greater. Nevertheless, it has been
proved that the increase of rate on exertion bears no relation
to the symptoms elicited and is therefore without value in
judging the functional efficiency of the heart.</p>

<h4><b>Case 139.</b> (<span class="smcap">Parkinson</span>, July, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A sergeant, 36, had been in the army from 17 to 29, but
in 1908 he had acute rheumatism and was discharged from
the army. He then became a furnace man and had shortness
of breath and palpitation on severe exertion with syncope
three times.</p>

<p>He re-enlisted in August, 1914, and had an attack of orthopnea
and edema after exposure at a review. However,
he improved and went to France in May, 1915, where he
again had symptoms; namely, precordial pain and breathlessness
on severe exertion. One day while carrying telephone
wire under fire, the sergeant felt a sudden pain in the
region of the apex beat, shooting down the right arm. “I
thought I was shot.” He fell down, very short of breath.
His left arm remained sore and weak. Two days later came
a similar attack, this time with unconsciousness, and the left
arm was now useless. Two days later he was admitted to
hospital, where slight breathlessness but no pain and no enlargement
of cardiac dulness could be found. No further
details are available but it seems clear that this man is unfit
for duty. According to Parkinson, it is probable that the
infection indicates the presence of some degree of myocardial
disease.</p>

<h4><b>Case 140.</b> (<span class="smcap">Karplus</span>, February, 1915.)</h4>

<p>An infantryman, aged 22, previously healthy and from a
healthy family, was struck by a shell fragment in the forehead
and lay for several hours unconscious. He did not
vomit. He had a number of furuncles on his body and his
urine, upon examination, showed a severe diabetes mellitus
which increased despite treatment. Upon an attempt to
withdraw carbohydrate, the sugar suddenly sank from six
to four per cent. Acetone at the same time increased. An
abrasion had been noticed by the patient a few days before
the shell explosion on the spot rubbed by the <i>tornister</i>. The
patient said that since his accident he had had to urinate
every night several times and was often very thirsty, neither
of which tendencies had he had before. A month before he
became <i>merod</i> he had had an injury of the hand produced by
a shell fragment. He had undergone tremendous strain.</p>

<p>The chances are that the excitement and the strain had

<h4><b>Case 141.</b> (<span class="smcap">Hollande</span> and <span class="smcap">Marchand</span>, March, 1917.)</h4>

<p>An adjutant in a chasseur battalion was buried by a shell
explosion, which killed his lieutenant beside him, January 5,
1915, at Hartmannsweilerkopf. Hematuria followed; ten days
later, fever with anorexia, and the appearance of two or three
lipomata on the anterior surface of the thighs. Remaining
at his post, the adjutant took part in an attack, March 5; was
evacuated on the 8th; “lipomatosis with febrile reactions.”
He spent eight days at Bussang, and thence went to the
hospital at Pont-de-Claix. Here marked albuminuria was
noted; the lipomata increased in volume; others appeared
in the arms. The patient was transferred to the Des-Genettes,
where the diagnosis nephritis was added to the
previous diagnosis, and a milk diet was prescribed. Convalescence
of five months was proposed. The lipomata
increased in volume and in number. The patient was then
hospitalized at Avenue Berthelot, placed in the auxiliaries,
and stationed eight months at his dépôt.</p>

<p>When he was observed by Hollande and Marchand, four
nut-sized tumors were found on the anterior surface of the
left thigh; two smaller tumors: one of them painful to pressure,
lay on the inner aspect, another the size of a small egg
lay in the right thigh, and there were two others on the internal
aspect and two on the external aspect of the thigh. A
nut-sized tumor was found on the inner border of the right
forearm, and below it another lenticular tumor. A nut-sized
tumor was found on the left forearm below the elbow
on the internal border. Small tumors were found on the
buttocks. There were no tumors below the knees, in the
upper arms, or on the thorax. There were 14 tumors in all.
The smaller the tumor the more sensitive, and there was
more pain when the tumor had just appeared and during
the first days of its growth. There was no spontaneous pain;
pain only upon a blow or pressure. Diminished knee-jerks,
especially the right; no other neurological disorder, although
the patient complained of often having something before his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
eyes. There was a marked diminution in the memory.
Heart was in the 5th space on the nipple line, pulse 110;
Wassermann reaction negative; red blood cells, 3,520,000,
white cells, 6500; albuminuria, hematuria, leucocytes, and
urethral cells in the urine. The temperature had now become
normal. The lateral lobes of the thyroid were slightly
larger than normal, but not painful. Sella turcica was unchanged
upon X-ray. Exploratory puncture of a tumor
showed much free fat, without fatty acid crystals and with
some fat cells. The cells could not be cultivated in test tube.
The authors believe it doubtful whether this instance of
Dercum’s disease is related with the shell explosion.</p>

<p>A private, 22, was selected by Col. Garrod for hypnotic
treatment by Tombleson from among the hyperthyroid
cases. He was admitted April 3, 1916, with a typical hyperthyroidism,
with manual tremor, enlarged thyroid, pulse
120, blood pressure 136-40, and hemic murmur. Tombleson
induced deep somnambulism at the first hypnotic sitting
and suggested an increase of nerve strength and steadiness.
The suggestions under somnambulism were repeated for
ten days. An occasional added suggestion was given as to
lessening of the thyroid. At the end of the ten days the
patient declared himself quite well.</p>

<p>Eight of twenty consecutive functional cases treated by
hypnotism by Tombleson were cases of hyperthyroidism and

<h4><b>Case 143.</b> (<span class="smcap">Dejerine and Gascuel</span>, December, 1914.)</h4>

<p>An infantryman, 29, was sent to auxiliary hospital No. 274,
for heart trouble, a little thin but looking vigorous enough
(typhoid fever at 13 and some diseases of unknown nature
and of brief duration while in military service).</p>

<p>September 24, a large calibre German shell burst and
threw him against a wall, producing no wound or contusion.
He was momentarily stunned, emotionally much affected,
and noted at the time extreme palpitation. He was evacuated
to Paris September 30, six days after the shock. His
pulse was 130-134, regular, and the heart seemed not to be
anomalous in any respect.</p>

<p>But there were paroxysmal crises in which the pulse rose to
180 and in which the patient fell into a state of great anxiety.
The mouth temperature in the midst of such crises would
always rise to 38°, and this temperature would outlast the
rest of the seizure. The man was mentally depressed and
apparently indifferent, preoccupied with his heart and his
insomnia, but at the same time emotionally easily affected.
In short, he was a neurasthenic. There was no change in
mental state, tachycardia, or paroxysmal seizures in two
months, except that he gained weight. Walking and climbing
stairs produced dyspnoea. Urine was negative. According
to Dejerine, such a case should be treated by psychotherapy.</p>

<p>Alquier, in discussion, called attention to the slight but distinct
tremor in this case, dermographia, and spells of perspiration.
He suggested that the case might be one of mild

<p>A man in service ten months, under strong excitement and
at times under protracted shell fire, complained of palpitation,
insomnia, dizziness, and dyspnoea. Hospital notes showed
that the left lobe of the thyroid was somewhat enlarged.
Before the war his neck could not have been very thick; he
had served his year out without difficulty. His mother is
said to have suffered at one time from thick neck. According
to the patient, he had never suffered with heart trouble.
Heart not enlarged; blowing first sound over the apex.
Graefe, Stellwag and Möbius signs negative. Heart rapid,
not irregular; pulse strong. There was fine tremor of the
hands, as well as a tremor of the tongue. Knee-jerks increased.</p>

<p>The patient was at first sleepless and excited, but after
three weeks in bed the heart murmur had disappeared. After
three months, he was ordered to <i>Ersatz</i> with the left side of
the neck measuring 20 as against 18 cm. on the right. There
was a soft pulsating swelling of the thyroid. First sound
over apex still impure; heart action now regular; pulse 64;
blood pressure 120 Riva-Rocci; after test exercises, slight
dyspnoea. No cyanosis. The outstretched hands were no
longer very tremulous. The knee-jerks were still increased.
The man had begun to sleep well. His neck was apparently
much diminished in girth.</p>

<p>A farmer, 31, entered the Rosendael Hospital, Jan. 25, 1917.
He had been two years in active service. The family history
was negative except that one of his sisters had had dyspepsia.
The patient denied venereal disease and alcoholism and had
always been well. At the Battle of the Marne he was slightly
wounded in the left knee. January, 1915, he was exposed to
gas bombs and explosive shells. He was several days in the
hospital spitting, or perhaps vomiting blood and was sent on
a long convalescence. On returning to the front, he had to
be sent back to hospital with a note, “not fit for service,
nervous troubles and paroxysmal tachycardia.” In point
of view he now showed a number of symptoms suggestive of
Graves’ disease, such as a definite exophthalmia which, according
to the patient, started up a short time after the shock
and a tachycardia (110-120) with circulatory excitement, a
tumultuous heart, neck arteries contracting, almost dancing
in their contractions, together with a systolic murmur maximal
in the pulmonary area, not retaining, variable,&mdash;in
short, suggestive of an inorganic murmur. There was also
a generalized rapid tremor and a variety of vasomotor disorders,
such as blushing and paling, perspiration, exaggerated
reflexes, emotionality, logorrhea, jactitation. There were
also digestive troubles, regurgitation after meals and the
patient had become thin and weak.</p>

<p>There was, however, no swelling of the thyroid gland nor
any eye signs other than the exophthalmia. In short this
case is doubtless one of the <i>forme fruste</i> of Graves’ disease. It
seems to show that Graves’ disease may have a traumatic
origin.</p>

<h4><b>Case 147.</b> (<span class="smcap">Bonhoeffer.</span>)</h4>

<p>A sick soldier in a military hospital kept complaining of
being waked up too early, and of poor food. His reactions
looked like the irritable weakness of a psychopath. One day
he went into a room where a woman was being examined,
without knocking. When ordered out, he boxed the Sister’s
ear.</p>

<p>He said himself, on transfer to the psychiatric clinic, that
he had always been quarrelsome as a child with his brothers
and sisters, subject to fainting spells, and poor and stubborn
in military service,&mdash;all of which seemed to clinch the diagnosis
of psychopathic constitution.</p>

<p>But he seemed to show a decided lack of autocritique.
About boxing the Sister’s ear on her saying “Please go out,”&mdash;his
idea was that he could not let a thing like that happen
to him,&mdash;a German soldier and a patient! Moreover, “It
should not be thought that perhaps I had a love affair with
her! There was a cynicism about her.” The Sister had a
strong sex impulse, he could see that by her nose: she was,
so to speak, “hypochondriacal.” Both in speech and writing
he used stilted phrases. The ego at last swelled to the
point of his saying that he was an inhabitant of the World
and hated Prussia and Prussian <i>Junkertum</i>.</p>

<p>Then came unmotivated states of excitement, with pressure
of speech and motion, and eventually negativism. Accordingly,
the diagnosis hebephrenia finally replaced that of
psychopathic constitution.</p>

by railroad to Dirschau; then he had visited Berlin. After
this, he had walked to Bromberg, Schneidemühl, and Landsberg.</p>

<p>At last he had ridden back to Küstrin. At Küstrin some
children told a railway official that the man was making
drawings. There was a petroleum tank near by. Accordingly,
he was arrested as a possible spy. He claimed that
he was not a soldier.</p>

<p>In the clinic, he looked dull and smiled a good deal. It
seems that, before being called to the colors, he had been very
angry with his wife and had even threatened her. He now
explained this anger as his wife’s fault. She had attacked
him, he said. He said that he sometimes had attacks of
weakness, which used to last two days at a time, but they had
recently lasted for a shorter time. He said that his thoughts
always wanted to be somewhere else. In fact, he had not
performed military duty. His uniform had been gotten for
him, but he had had no further orders. Sometimes in a fever
or dream his head seemed to be as big as a room, as if there
were no space for it. There was an itching in his legs, he
said, which often fell asleep so he could not stand on them.
He had had syphilis seven years before, after which he had
been hoarse, forgetful, and anxious.</p>

<p>Examination showed perceptive power and knowledge to be
good. He played the violin, but always the same tunes.
He said that he had not worked in Berlin during the winter
of 1914. He spoke as if he had been in another sanitarium,
where he did nothing but dream by himself, taking no interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
in things, and lying indifferently, with a blanket over
him.</p>

<p>He said that when he received the uniform he had a longing
for clean underclothes. Requested to explain the meaning
of the uniform, he remarked: “Why, many have these
things on.”</p>

<p><i>Re</i> dementia praecox, Lépine states that in the French
army instances of dementia praecox have been numerous in
the interior, both at the time of mobilization and at the
time of calling out sundry new classes. He notes that the
courtmartial and invaliding experts have neither the leisure
nor the experience necessary to keep these men from going
into the army. The somewhat frequent remissions in dementia
praecox make the task all the more difficult. To be
sure, the stuporous and catatonic cases are not very much
in evidence in the army; when such cases do occur, it is easy
enough to evacuate the patients to a hospital for observation.
Far more troublesome are cases of a less advanced or
milder nature. Here are cases in which judgment is deficient,
and in which quite unsystematic, incoherent, and transient
delusional ideas occur. The patient looks quite normal to
the non-psychiatric expert. Something odd happens which
quite suddenly reveals the delusional ideas. For example,
there is a fugue, or else the soldier goes to his superior and
aggressively chides him for having troubled him the night
before. These particular psychopaths are among the most
dangerous to be found in the army.</p>

<p>Fugue, catatonic.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 149.</b> (<span class="smcap">Boucherot</span>, 1915-6.)</h4>

<p>A gunner, aged 23, enlisted on the expiration of his regular
period of service and was a good soldier, in excellent health,
up to June, 1915. He then began to have a few vague ideas
of persecution. In a short time these became more definite
and he caused talk by requesting to go into another corps
because his comrades did not like him. He told his brigadier
that the soldiers were frightening him by magnetism. He had
hallucinations of hearing people say, “He will get it.” He
kept by himself, would not eat and stood motionless for
long periods of time before his mess-tin. He was often found
in a dreamy state of apathy. One day he left the cantonment
without leave, wandered through fields, had coffee in a village
and then started off in no special direction. The police
took him without resistance the next day. He said, “My
comrades are in politics; they are going to cheat me.” He
was brought to Fismes and the ambulance surgeon said
that he found he did not know what he was about. He was
amnestic for the fugue, explaining that he went because he
was frightened. It was hard to get him to eat.</p>

<p>July 14, he was evacuated to Fleury protesting arrogantly,
but this phase of excitement passed and he became absolutely
indifferent and disoriented. He became untidy in his person
and in no way could his attention be attracted whether by
mentioning his family or the war. He sometimes made ape-like
grimaces and sometimes laughed causelessly. He was
occasionally negativistic, but in general was perfectly compliant
with the requirements of the hospital. Now and then
he started off impulsively to escape but was brought back
quite indifferent. Now and then he went into bizarre contortions
on a medical visit or aped gestures of bystanders.
He began then to go into stereotypical attitudes. This case
is the only catatonic one found by Boucherot in his war
group.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="case150">
<p>Desertion: Schizophrenic-looking behavior. Adjudged
responsible.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 150.</b> (<span class="smcap">Consiglio</span>, 1915.)</h4>

<p>An Italian private in the artillery, a telephone operator
at the front, came up for desertion in the face of the enemy.
It seems that he had often left his post, going off for a number
of hours and drinking. At last he lost his position in the
battery, went off and got drunk again, and was removed to a
hospital and held as a neurasthenic and psychopathic patient.
At the territorial hospital he was regarded as a melancholic.
He still showed signs of alcoholism, was hallucinated,
did a number of peculiar things, was impatient of medical
examination, and was given a furlough of two months for
convalescence. He apparently grew somewhat better in
his father’s home, but went to a physician there and presented
his certificate as a mental case. His behavior was so
peculiar on subsequent arrest that he was sent for observation
to Consiglio.</p>

<p>It appeared that he had been in military service from
August, 1912, and had been imprisoned for a space of eight
weeks for disobedience when he had been in military service
for six months. He had been punished in the army nine
times, once being given 70 days for lying. He was regarded
as an undisciplined soldier but not as a nervous or mental case.</p>

<p>At hospital he was in a semi-stupor, claimed that he was
forgetful, was apathetic concerning home and relatives, complained
of pain in the head, and altogether preserved a
strange and stolid attitude with occasional gestures, mimicry,
and stereotyped reactions. As he had come to be operated
upon, he looked about for the cannon that was to be used in
the operation. Accordingly the question of dementia praecox
might well be raised.</p>

<p>His indifference turned out actually to be assumed and
pretentious. He preserved throughout an arrogant tone, and
there were features in his voice that strongly suggested simulation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>According to Consiglio, we are dealing with an epileptic
degenerate, addicted to alcohol, lying, and immorality. The
question concerning responsibility was settled in the affirmative.
Of course, it might be thought that the case was
one of pathological intoxication, in which case, the man might
be regarded as only semi-responsible. However, the phenomena
of simulation, not merely in the observation hospital but
also in the period of apparent depression and strange conduct
immediately following his arrest for desertion, led to
the decision that the man, despite his nervous abnormality,
was responsible for his act. He was condemned to 20 years
in prison.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> dementia praecox, Buscaino and Coppola found a number
of cases of dementia praecox amongst soldiers admitted
to hospital during the period of mobilization; cases amongst
men who had not yet been at the front. These mobilization
cases, in fact, were as a rule either cases of dementia praecox,
cases of a psychopathic constitution, or cases of alcoholism.</p>

<p>A disciplinary case: Schizophrenia, alcoholism.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 151.</b> (<span class="smcap">Kastan</span>, January, 1916.)</h4>

<p>In October, 1914, a German soldier returned to his barracks
late from a drinking bout. He insolently called for order,
brandishing his arms, and when the captain rebuked him, he
kept a cigar in his mouth. Examined in hospital (Allenberg),
he was very reticent at first but wrote his name up over the
bed with the additional word “<i>Dead</i>.” He answered, “I
don’t know” to most questions. Although it was December,
he said the season was summer. He was to be shot for
disrespect, he said, but showed more disrespect at every
remonstrance. “What is your regiment?” “I am no soldier
at all, you know. I have already been discharged as
unfit for service.” “Have you been in prison?” “I don’t
know. My father often thrashed me.” Then suddenly,
after a moment, “I was in prison five, seven, and two years,
and my father was in prison four, six, and three years.” He
said that he had drunk ether and urged the physician to try it,
as one saw all sorts of beautiful pictures and figures and heard
music.</p>

<p>Upon investigation, it was found that the man had been
in a provincial sanatorium for some form of degenerative
mental disease with excitement. He, at this time, had given
a number of fantastic stories concerning his wanderings.
For example, he said he had come from Australia, where he
had eaten snipes and crows; that he was on his way home and
would get there in half an hour (real distance 10 hours).
Or again, he would roll his eyes, assume a false name and say
that he had come from Morocco, or that he was the emperor
and would not play soldier. When asked to repeat digits, he
habitually omitted the last digit. He had been a poor scholar,
and of a tricky and treacherous character.</p>

<p>Despite this history, he had behaved well in the army at
first, though insolent to superiors. On July 5 he had a heavy
drinking bout, and wrote next day to his mother that he was
going to commit suicide. At this time he had been put for
safe keeping in a cell, where he saw foxes making as if to bite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
him. He also said that he was a rich nobleman, a cavalry
captain with a servant (asked to be given his pressed clothes
and his cigarettes), and was being pursued. He rode his
pillow as if it were his horse, and hid it in the horse’s stable,
namely, the bed. He ate nothing, as he thought everything
was poisoned; smeared himself with faeces and drank urine
as “strawberry punch.”</p>

<p>We are evidently here dealing with a psychopath of schizophrenic
tendencies, strongly colored, however, by alcoholism.
The patient’s father was a drunkard, and a brother and
sister were insane.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> schizophrenia in the German army, Saenger remarks
that like paresis, so also latent dementia praecox becomes
acute under war conditions. E. Meyer states that amongst
1126 officers admitted to his hospital, August 1, 1915, there
were 352 that had either psychoses or neuroses, amongst
which were 148 psychogenic cases (either psychopathic or
hysterical), 128 with what he terms a congenital psychopathic
diathesis, and 76 with traumatic neuroses. The
cases of congenital diathesis were somewhat difficult to diagnose,
since but 44 of these were clearly psychopathic and in
the remainder the question of dementia praecox or of cyclothymic
conditions arose.</p>

<p>Stier gives statistics for 1905 and 1906 in the German
army, namely 35 per cent of dementia praecox cases. Under
war conditions the army has developed far fewer cases:
Bonhoeffer, 7 per cent; Meyer, 7.5 per cent; Hahn, 13 per
cent. But although dementia praecox figures so much less
frequently in the mobilized army than in the army of peace
times (manic depressive psychosis is also less in evidence
under war conditions), the psychopathic constitutions, hysterias,
traumatic neuroses, and the like, run from 17.5 per
cent (Stier, 1905-1906) to 54 per cent (Bonhoeffer), 37.5
(Meyer), 43 per cent (Hahn).</p>

</div>

<h4><b>Case 152.</b> (<span class="smcap">De la Motte</span>, August, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A Landsturm recruit, 20, and somewhat peculiar in early
life, got whipped by his comrades for getting back too late from
leave. The next day he was commanded to carry a machine
gun. He threw the gun down and made for the barracks.
He was put under psychiatric observation, as he said he did
not know what he was doing. His conduct seemed normal
at first and he explained that he had heard noises and singing
in his head,&mdash;pointing to the left ear where there was an
otitis media. His skill, knowledge, and general experience
seemed well in hand. However, he was not very communicative.
Eventually a series of schizophrenic symptoms came
to light. He had been hearing threatening voices of varying
intensity for two years, sometimes a veil seemed to be before
his eyes, sometimes he heard his thoughts, and felt that his
whole personality was changing. He began to think that
his facial traits were gradually turning into those of the
physician. The hallucinations were so insistent that sometimes
he did not know what he should do. He was evidently
unfit for military service, and the decision was also made
that the mental disease had been aggravated by service.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> schizophrenia in the service, most authors point out
that there was either patent or latent schizophrenia before
mobilization. E. Meyer attempted to make a study of the
influence of the war on psychopaths. He found that the
ego of the psychopath remained relatively unaffected by the
war. Naturally, the paretics and the seniles were unaffected.
The grandiosity and self-centredness of the alcoholics remained
as prominent as ever. Seventeen schizophrenic cases
were studied, and some of these yielded entire apathy with
respect to the war; others had the content of their delusions
somewhat affected. Saaler remarks on the military tinge
which dementia praecox assumes under war conditions.
Dementia praecox and manic-depressive psychosis alike show
war changes.</p>

<p>Shot himself in hand. Delusions.</p>

<h4><b>Case 153.</b> (<span class="smcap">Rouge</span>, 1915.)</h4>

<p>An infantryman, 26, left for the front August, 1914, was
slightly wounded, recovered, went back to the front, and then
is said, in March, 1915, to have shot himself in the hand.
When up for military review a delusional state set in. It
seems that he had been interned in several hospitals for examination,
but escaped four or five times because physicians
wanted to poison him and had partially succeeded.</p>

<p>He came to the Lemioux Custodial Institution, July 12,
1915. His brother, 15, was a <i>voyou</i>; his sister, 16, was an
imbecile. The patient told about his military history and
how he had shot himself in the left hand, to be with a certain
woman, how attempts had been made to poison him, especially
a certain man in Bordeaux, who wanted to possess the
woman in the case. In point of fact, the physicians could
not save him from this enemy.</p>

<p>The patient now became calm and indifferent, lived secluded
and almost immobile. In November, however, he
began to sit down and eat like others, making low, timorous
answers, vague and confused. He smiled cheerfully on
questioning, but had many sad ideas. He would smilingly
say that he was going to die soon.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> schizophrenia in the French army, Boucherot found
eight cases amongst 107 soldiers admitted to Loiret in the
first year of the war. He remarks upon the fact that the
schizophrenic cases were often disciplinary. The group is a
disciplinary group. Damaye remarks upon the difficulty of
diagnosis betwixt feeblemindedness and dementia praecox

<p>N. enlisted voluntarily for three years in the Infantry,
September 10, 1912, and immediately gave indications of
abnormal mentality by his conduct. He made mistakes all
day long. At reveille he had to be called several times, and
when his corporal objected, he said, “It is cold; I don’t see
why I must get up; I am free to remain in bed until 8 o’clock.”
In reply to his corporal’s remonstrance about his continued
latenesses, he once said, “I can’t get ready; I have no
mirror to wash before.” This was rather surprising conduct
from an intelligent printer-engraver, who had lived and gone
to school in the town of Lyons. He was unable to make his
own bed or to perform the simplest of exercises in the manual
of arms. He was violent on several occasions, once attacking
a comrade who had given him an order, and again when
another had taken his place in the line. His reasoning
faculties were those of a young child. He continued doing
these strange things, and was finally discharged.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> dementia praecox amongst American troops, Edgar
King, before the war, concluded that some 5 to 8 per cent
of the American cases of mental disease in the army belonged
to the paranoid form of dementia praecox. King lays special
emphasis upon dementia praecox, finding that more than
one-half of the army admissions for mental disease belong
to this group. He calls attention to the number of desertions
and undesirables in the group. He found that 70
per cent of the cases showed some heredity.</p>

<p>Hysteria versus catatonia.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 155.</b> (<span class="smcap">Bonhoeffer</span>, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A reservist, 31, was in the hospital about Christmas, 1914,
for rheumatism, when suddenly he became excited and was
sent to the Charité Psychiatric Clinic. He was restless all
night, moving about in bed, grinding his teeth, and continually
getting up. He had a blank and astonished expression;
his breathing was rapid and forced. There were no pyramidal
tract symptoms, but muscular power was diminished,&mdash;more
on the right than on the left. While the
knee-jerks were being tested, the legs moved (seemingly
psychogenic). Irregular hypalgetic zones were found, and
pain was less well felt on the right side than on the left.
Answers to questions on mental examination were made with
the appearance of effort, the patient breathing deeply and
rapidly, head drooping, forehead wrinkling, and eyes glancing
about in an astonished way. “How many legs has a
horse?” After long cogitation, the man counted slowly,&mdash;1,
2, 3, 4. “What’s your wife’s name?” “Marie&mdash;Marie,
I think.”</p>

<p>In the interpretation of this case, the functional paresis
and hypalgesia of the right side, the functional pseudoclonus
obtained during the knee-jerk test, the mental situation,&mdash;rather
suggestive of a hysterical pseudodementia or
a “Ganser” dazed state,&mdash;make the probable diagnosis at
first sight psychogenic. Left to himself, however, the patient
assumed a stereotyped unchanging posture; he would
suddenly cry out, without particular emotion, that he was
to be shot or executed; there was a tendency to rhythmic
repetition of certain answers to questions, with the suggestion
of perseveration.</p>

<p>After a time, pronounced rhythmic, and then stereotyped,
movements started in. Suddenly negativistic phenomena,
with refusal of food and self-accusatory ideas set in; speech
stopped altogether. Information from his relatives showed
that he had been peculiar for some time and had for years
occasionally said that he was going to be shot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>Here then, instead of a hysterical pseudodementia, was a
case of hebephrenia or perhaps catatonia. Possibly there
had been no pseudodementia, but actually an elementary
disorder in the associative process. Possibly the defects
which the patient early showed, in his responses, for example,
were really genuine schizophrenic blocking.</p>

<p>According to Lewandowsky, almost all cases of neurasthenia,
of hysteria, and of the so-called traumatic neuroses,
stand out very clearly as functional. Bonhoeffer is far less
certain that the diagnosis can be made readily in all cases.
Antebellum conditions have not been continued in wartime;
hysteria was a female affair antebellum, but under
war conditions, it is found necessary to draw many differential
diagnoses in the male betwixt schizophrenics, epileptics,
and psychotics, on the one hand, and hysterics on the
other.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> the so-called Ganser symptom, Hesnard has dealt especially
with the value of what he calls the symptom of “absurd
answers,” finding the differential diagnosis between
dementia praecox and simulation particularly difficult.
Hesnard states that incoherence is very hard to simulate.
The answers of the Ganser patient are not always incorrect,
and not always absurd. The patient strikes one as intact
except for the absurd answers; intimidation and other external
conditions affect the symptom greatly. Drugs are
refused by the Ganser patient.</p>

<p>A shell burst about twenty-five meters away from a soldier,
21, but he continued in the military service thereafter for one
month, having only one symptom, a trembling of the arm.
This persisting, he was evacuated to Calais, then to Dury to
the hospital for the insane where he stayed six months. He
was transferred from Dury to the Belgian Hospital for the
Insane at Chateaugiron on August 20, 1915. He remembered
nothing of his stay at Dury, Calais, or of anything
that happened after the shell-shock. He had no complaint
and wanted to go back to the front. He was well oriented
for time and space and had no disorders of association or
perception. Besides the persistent, retrograde amnesia, he
showed certain neurological disorders, occasional slight vertigo,
a generalized tremor especially affecting the arms but
disappearing almost completely at rest, lively tendon reflexes,
intense dermographia and cardiac erethism. Diagnosis
was made of acute, convulsional psychosis with agitation,
convalescent phase.</p>

<p>During March he was quiet and worked about the hospital.
In April the patient had a number of seizures of an hysterical
nature. In June it was possible to evacuate him to full convalescence.
He went back to the front and stayed there, but
shortly developed catatonic signs with visual hallucinations
and delusions of persecution of a non-systematized nature,
such as poisoning, being magnetized, etc. He was at this
time poorly oriented for time, assumed bizarre and theatrical
attitudes, showed Ganser’s symptom, was oversuggestible
and agitated and sleepless. Diagnosis of dementia praecox
was now clear.</p>

were some of his hallucinations and delusions:</p>

<p>The patient asserted that everyone considered him a spy.
Voices continually told him: “You are a spy.” “What?
Spy? Caught? What?” “You will be shot by the Germans
for espionage.” About three months before his present
trouble, the patient had been wounded in left shoulder by a
fragment of a large projectile. The wound healed and examination
showed a big scar with attachments to the bone.
The patient asserted that now he could not touch anything
with his left hand, as there immediately go from it “some
currents” to the Germans in the trenches and they at once
begin shooting at the Russian position. Later, the patient
could not even look in the direction of the German front,
for all he had to do was to throw a glance in that direction
and the Germans would at once begin a bombardment.</p>

<p>All these phenomena he explained as being due to the fact
that the fragments of the large projectile which entered his
shoulder were poisoned and charmed. Through these fragments
there went currents from his hands to the Germans.
The patient always supported his left hand with his right,
in order not to touch anything with it. He slept only on his
right side, so as not to touch the bed or floor with his left
hand. During the examination and conversation the patient
tried always to look downwards, so as not to throw a chance
look in the direction of the German front and call out their
fire.</p>

<h4><b>Case 158.</b> (<span class="smcap">Bonhoeffer</span>, 1915.)</h4>

<p>An Iron Cross winner, 21, in the field from August, 1914,
to the middle of March, 1915, at first in France, later in
Russia, finally went to hospital for rheumatism and sciatica.
Three months later he had to be transferred to the Charité
in a state of delirious excitement.</p>

<p>The attack began suddenly. He thought he was in the
field telephoning with his captain, trembled, threatened to
injure people about him, said he could not hold the position
with the few men he had, and the like. Next day he quieted
down and became oriented for time and place. He explained
that he had seen a Gurkha coming upon him with a mallet,
by way of revenge upon him because he had stuck his bayonet
in the Gurkha’s breast. Behind a little hill he had
seen Frenchmen and Englishmen, from which he drew the
conclusion there was going to be an attack that night. A
little cloud of dust he thought was enemy cavalry. In point
of fact, he said he had once on patrol stuck a Gurkha through
and the Gurkha’s eyes had since followed him in his mind.
He had seen him crawling along the ground one evening and
heard his step. The patient had imperfect insight into
these hallucinations when questioned about them during the
daytime, and still talked somewhat as if the experience was a
real one.</p>

<p>At first the situation seemed probably one of hysterical
delusion, for which the Gurkha experience served as material.
In point of fact, further observation in the clinic showed that
the diagnosis of hysteria was wrong. He was induced to
write out his experience in a style quite like his conversation;
and there was a queer tendency in his writing to the use of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
foreign words, somewhat improperly used. After a time he
began to sit about dully and at times to run about and
throw himself into and out of bed, or strike rhythmically
with his shoes on the floor, or draw his shoulders together,
making grimaces, rolling his eyes and breathing deeply. He
said he had to make these movements involuntarily if he
were in some way excited. But the peculiar conduct also
often occurred without any emotional prod. His emotions
were variable, but on the whole indifferent and not always
quite suitable.</p>

<p>He frequently said he wanted to get into the field again,
giving vent to superficial phrases, such as “atrocities, concrete
and abstract,” and “this damned war that is so vulgar.”
Yet a few minutes later he would say he wanted to go to war
at Amsterdam as Amsterdam had pleased him very much.
He said he now had a good many thoughts and ideas which
formerly he had not had. He had not been promoted, he
said, because he had once angered an officer in another company.</p>

<p>His field hospital history told of certain oddities, such as
his lying stiffly in bed heedless of what was going on about
him, falling into causeless depression, failing to sleep, and
wandering about.</p>

<p>As to previous life, only his own data were available.
He had been a moderate scholar, had been rather irritable
and thought a peculiar character. In the ward, he showed
baseless antipathy to certain patients and said they were
well. He seemed to have no insight into his condition,
yet wrote in a letter that the insane state in which he was
had very much “augmented his mental organism.” The
diagnosis of early hebephrenic disorder could now be considered
established.</p>

<p>Occipital trauma. Mystical visual hallucinations

</div>

<h4><b>Case 159.</b> (<span class="smcap">Claude</span>, <span class="smcap">Lhermitte</span>, <span class="smcap">Vigouroux</span>, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A soldier, 33, single, was wounded in the right occipital
region by a shell burst September 25, 1915. There was no
sign of focal lesion, but a trephining operation was done,
which healed perfectly. No disturbance of vision ensued.
The soldier was sent to convalesce two months after having
been examined by P. Marie at the Salpêtrière. He went
back to his regimental station and was put into the auxiliary
service April 26, 1916.</p>

<p>In the early days of September, that is to say, a year after
his injury, he had a vision. Above the church cross at
Chantenay, where he then was, he saw a rainbow-colored
bird, passing slowly in the sky. He lowered his eyes and the
apparition followed and was projected on the white walls
around him. After some time it disappeared. The soldier
himself wondered whether his brain injury might not have
something to do with the vision, but none of his comrades
wounded in the head had had any such vision. So then he
thought of tobacco, of which he was a moderate user, and
stopped smoking, but the vision returned in the same intensity
four months later. On examining the bird’s face
carefully, he found that it was the Holy Virgin’s. In dreams
he also had analogous visions and in the dreams the Holy
Virgin spoke to him, but what she said he did not
remember. The bird’s head did not speak to him. The
soldier was now convinced that it really was the Holy Virgin
who had visited him in the form of a bird. He remembered
that he had asked Notre Dame de Lourdes to protect him on
the day when he was injured. He had, in fact, eaten a bit
of cheese that day upon which he had inscribed a prayer to
the Holy Virgin.</p>

<p>Sometimes he saw a red globe shining like a church lamp;
sometimes white or black ladies descending from the sky;
sometimes other visions. Now the Holy Virgin was to direct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
all the soldier’s life, but why should he be specially favored?
Was he not to be called sooner or later to hold a high rank?
He confessed, in fact, that he was to be the King of France,
and, like Joan of Arc, was to save his country. Now the
soldier began to understand the hidden significance of his
surroundings. Everything around him was symbolic, thus,
white, of purity, order and royalty; red, of anarchy, disorder
and atheism. Some white ship which he saw outstripping
some darker ship showed him how the kingdom of France
was arriving once more. In fact, there was a symbolism in
the whites and yolks of eggs, and the proportion of yolk to
white was as one to five. He made talismans to exorcise
bad spirits.</p>

<p>Were there auditory hallucinations? If so, they were only
episodic and took no part in either the construction or the
fixation of the man’s delusional system. Thus, a voice once
said to him, “All is not lost. You will be &mdash;&mdash;.” May 25,
1917, he entered the neurological center at Bourges.</p>

<p>As to the interpretation of this case, it seems that the
patient’s mother had crises of depression which at one time
caused her to be interned in the Charité. The contributors
of this case do not believe that there can be any causal link
set up between the mystical delusions and the brain injury.</p>

<p>As an auxiliary the soldier has a right to twenty per cent
compensation for his head wound with loss of substance
without bulging of the dura mater. Of course, as an insane
person he must be retired. The aggravating or accelerating
part played by fatigue, emotion and cranial trauma must,
from the standpoint of compensation, be taken into account.</p>

<p>Shell-shock dementia praecox.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 160.</b> (<span class="smcap">Weygandt</span>, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A subaltern who had been in the service since 1909 was on
patrol under shell fire from the enemy, but shortly thereafter
came with his detachment into the zone of the German fire.
Six men, two steps away from him, were killed by a shell.
The officer remained stationary with the rest of his detachment
until darkness set in, then returned, made his report
in due order, but thereafter tremors set in over his whole
body and he lost consciousness. He was carried to the
hospital and on the way met his best friend whom he did not
recognize. Arrived at the hospital he was unable to give
answers to questions or obey requests for two or three hours.
He thought he was hearing calls, commands and a dull
<i>dröhnen</i>. If an automobile passed he was frightened and
cried, “Auto! Auto!” He remained subject to inhibition,
anxiety and insomnia for a long time; pulse accelerated;
visual fields somewhat contracted for red. Face asymmetrically
innervated and dermatographia. Sent to the reserve
hospital, he was still apprehensive, especially at night, but in
the course of a few days became perfectly tranquil. Only
if he took part in the singing of war songs did he feel transient
sensations in his knees.</p>

<p>Here is a case of psychic shock with many traits, such as
inhibition and hallucinations, suggestive of dementia praecox.
The Abderhalden reactions (cortex, white matter, testes,
not thyroid) all, according to Weygandt, are suggestive also
of dementia praecox.</p>

<h4><b>Case 161.</b> (<span class="smcap">Dupuoy</span>, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A machine gunner, 23, was the sole survivor, March 18,
1915, of the explosion of a large calibre shell in a block house
containing ten men. He worked himself out of the débris
and came to Dupuoy’s attention in September, when an extension
of leave was asked for him.</p>

<p>There were two groups of symptoms; persistent headache,
painful hyperacousia, vertigo, tremulous walk, cervical
spinal column stiff and painful both spontaneously and to
pressure, muscular weakness, tremor of hands, hypesthesia
of extremities especially upper, exaggeration of tendon and
bone reflexes with tendency to ankle clonus and patellar
clonus, sterno sign lively, frequent nosebleeds (two to four
times a week), profound sweating, unequal pupils.</p>

<p>On the mental side it was clear that the man’s character had
changed, according to information supplied by the mother.
Aprosexia, impairment of memory, recollective and retentive,
inability to give age, birth date and similar data. Words
came with difficulty. Some disorder of comprehension;
stereotyped replies; negativism; indifference; he would sit
hours in a chair or on a bed silent and inactive. Fixed
attitudes; dull glance; eyelids half closed. In short, it
seemed as if this patient was a case of catatonic dementia
praecox.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> dementia praecox and shell-shock, Stansfield remarks
upon the similarity of certain symptoms found in Shell-shock
to those of dementia praecox; for example, apathy,
retardation, amnesia and speech defect. According to Stansfield,
one often gets the impression in a Shell-shock case as
though the trench and shell fire stress had merely brought
out a latent dementia praecox.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> his new “sterno” sign (sternomastoid contraction on
percussion of neck at level of third dorsal vertebra), Dupouy
claims it negative in normal subjects, positive in concussion,

<p>Shell-shock; fatigue; fugue; delusions. Recovery.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 162.</b> (<span class="smcap">Rouge</span>, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A sergeant, 40, had had nineteen years of service and had
been married five months when he was recalled to the colors
when war broke out, and sent to the front. March, 1915,
he was exposed to bomb explosions during a very intense
bombardment. He then got into the way of saying that he
was akin to everybody. April 20, he was evacuated on the
score of general fatigue, rejoined the company May 17, left
his comrades at the end of June, and was taken up as a
deserter by the police, who, observing his state, brought him
to a hospital. He there showed “cerebral overexcitement”
with “incoherence and nervousness.” In two or three days
he was much better. He was evacuated on the sixth day to
the hospital at Vichy.</p>

<p>There was amnesia for the fugue and he could remember no
further back than the extraction of a tooth at the Vichy
hospital. In fact, he attributed the fugue to this dental
operation. His wife took him home, but he soon threatened
her with a revolver; got better in the night and next day went
about apparently normal, buying things, however, extravagantly.
His delusional state began once more, and two days
later he was brought to Limoux. It seems that, while in
Mauretania, he had formerly shown signs of mental disorder,
having a mania for wireless and airplane inventions and the
like. A cousin-german had also been in a hospital for the
insane twice, recovering each time. There was a lingual and
manual tremor. The man had not been recently alcoholic.
He was a little irritable and showed a little megalomania,
but worked hard and made himself useful. He went out,
recovered, November 12, 1915.</p>

<p>Analysis indicated that this sergeant received a moral
shock as a consequence of his fatigue and the shell fire, which
emerged in a spell of confusion. It may be that his predisposition
had something to do also with this spell and the
fatigue. In any event, it seems as if the latter phenomena
were not all assignable to war stress.</p>

<p>An Alsatian became the object of much attention when he
enlisted at the outbreak of the war in the infantry at the age
of 59. He was interviewed and soon became more than
naturally exuberant. The peculiar things he did soon brought
him to Fleury in a gay and expansive mood, singing and
talking as hail fellow with everyone he met.</p>

<p>The next day he grew more excited, disrobed and threw his
things out of the window, filled his bed with excrement and
wanted to smear the orderly therewith. He took other
attendants for old friends and wanted to kiss them. His
language and ideas were incoherent. He broke glass.</p>

<p>This situation of alternate joy and anger lasted one month,
leaving him in an excitable, unruly state. He wrote many
prolix letters to the prefects and the ministers, insisting on
the discharge of certain patients and offering plans for the
defense of France. He got better and finally, in October,
1914, was invalided home still slightly exalted.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> the cyclothymias, Montembault remarks that manias
have been less numerous than melancholias in the present
war, whereas in 1870, manias were more common than melancholias.
Morselli likewise remarks upon the rarity of
manias amongst the Italian soldiers. Butenko reports upon
the maniacal cases amongst the Russians and how the men
wish to enter the ranks, the women the nurse corps. E.
Meyer, for Germany, found 4 per cent manic-depressives.
Birnbaum quotes from Bonhoeffer (3 per cent) and Hahn

<p>Fugue: melancholia.</p>

<h4><b>Case 164.</b> (<span class="smcap">Logre</span>, 1916.)</h4>

<p>Logre classifies as a melancholic fugue the adventures of a
man who had been depressed for some days, had stopped
talking and eating, and ran away suddenly in the middle of
an attack of anxious agitation. He was very anxious over
the health of his daughter, whom he thought to be severely
ill. It was, in fact, to go to Paimpol that he deserted, but he
deserted with his arms and without any money. He went off
on foot “in the Brittany direction.” He had gone 50 kilometers,
the next day, and was picked up near Chateau-Thierry
by two gendarmes, who fell upon him, seeing his
regalia, and cried, “Give yourself up!” He replied in a firm
voice, “No, I shall not give myself up!” and seizing his gun
he made at one of the gendarmes. There was a fight. The
gendarme declared in his report that he judged it opportune
to retreat behind a tree. The soldier, knowing his trench
lore very well, barricaded himself behind a pile of beets.
There he would have held the gendarmes in check for some
time if another had not succeeded by a détour through some
woods, in catching him. He gave himself up after firing
several ineffective shots, but not without getting a bullet in
his left thigh himself. With the charge of desertion and
attempt to murder, he was handed over for mental examination.
He was, in fact, a melancholic patient, subject to
attacks of anxiety, and requiring long observation at a
neuropsychiatric center for diagnosis.</p>

<p>Chavigny observed numerous victims of melancholia characterized
by war terror. He remarks a somewhat curious
fact that, whereas the melancholics were numerous and their
mental states related to the war, on the other hand, the
paretics were rather apt to be maniacal than melancholic.
Soukhanoff, however, remarks on the occurrence of depression
in a great number of types of psychosis, as was found
in the Russo-Japanese war. Soukhanoff found frequent instances
of schizophrenia, wherein the melancholia tends to
conceal the actual dementia praecox. Soukhanoff predicted
that depression will figure largely in the war.</p>

<p>Apples in No-Man’s-Land.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 165.</b> (<span class="smcap">Weygandt</span>, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A soldier in November, 1914, suddenly climbed out of the
trench and began to pick apples from an apple-tree between
the firing lines. The idea was to get a bag of apples for his
comrades, but he began to pelt the French trenches with
apples. He was called back and on account of his strange
conduct sent to hospital. Here he was at times given to
pressure of speech and restlessness; he would climb the posts
of the sleeping room and then loudly declare he wanted to
get back to the trenches; he did not want to go back to Germany
alive; did not want to live over to-morrow; was guilty
of a sin; had a spot of sin, <i>Schand</i>, on his heart. Sometimes
he refused food and said anything else tasted better. It
seemed he had formerly talked about the Iron Cross.</p>

<p>After being transported to Germany, he was at first a
little negativistic and apparently blocked. He talked about
his experiences and said he wanted to go to Russia. He explained
the episode of the apples on the basis that they were
all really hungry and that he had sought to encourage his
comrades who were unused to war. He had noticed the
French all shot too high.</p>

<p>Physically there was a somewhat uneven innervation of
the face, unilateral epicanthus and an areflexia of pharynx.
Now and then the man was very irritable, but in general he
was in an elevated frame of mind.</p>

<p>Weygandt interprets this case as one of hypomania, remarking
that war influences may serve to bring out preëxisting
manic depressive tendencies.</p>

<h4><b>Case 166.</b> (<span class="smcap">Gerver</span>, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A Russian reservist, a private, 38, went into the trenches,
March, 1915. Without taking part in any battles or sustaining
any injury, he four months later became depressed
and had to be evacuated to a hospital and thence to the
interior, little changed for the better.</p>

<p>He was an ill-nourished man, of middle height, with pallid
skin and membranes; arteries sclerotic; face, eyelids, and
tongue finely tremulous; hands tremulous; slight dermatographia;
exaggerated tendon reflexes; pulse 100.</p>

<p>He seemed disoriented for time and place; looked weary;
walked with back bent over; spoke in whispers, and appeared
somewhat unclear. Thinking was slow and difficult.</p>

<p>He occasionally shuddered and looked to one side, said he
was afraid, and was constantly troubled by thoughts of fire.
The Germans were pursuing him; he could hear their voices
and footsteps. He himself was doomed, and his family also;
he felt he was the cause of all the domestic woe. His own
heart was dying away; he had fits of anguish and causeless
fear, and was under the constant expectation of death.</p>

<p>One day, he escaped from the hospital and went to the
chief physician’s tent, where he lay on the ground. When
he was found and asked why he was there, he begged the
physician to save him from the Germans. The man was not
alcoholic and had no previous history of mental disease.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> early arteriosclerosis, Maitland in the second interim
report of the British Association Committee on Fatigue in
Warfare, speaks of the many Serbians, who, after six years
of nearly continuous Balkan war, show a marked arteriosclerosis.
Maitland remarks that the line officers were already
showing (1916) a growing delicacy of perception as
to the “breaking point.” Men that do not break may
return from the lines, pale, with low blood pressure, and a
<i>faiblesse irritable</i>, shown by restlessness of hands and feet.</p>

<h4><b>Case 167.</b> (<span class="smcap">Dumesnil</span>, 1915-6.)</h4>

<p>A naval officer, 22, transferred from sea service, went into
Belgium, November, 1914, in a Fusilleur brigade of marines
and there greatly distinguished himself, growing very weary
and enervated, however, about the middle of April, 1915.
His attitude to the men altered: he sometimes struck them;
gently, though, according to his account. They must do
in ten seconds what they really could not do under ten
minutes. The officer, in fact, had lost all notion of time.
He went about agitatedly, contradicted his superior officers
and was troubled because, as he said, they often were men of
inexperience as compared to himself. He grew irritated, too,
because there were Free Masons in the army and when he
was sent to the asylum in July, 1915, said it was the doing of
the Free Masons. He did not seem to have any hallucinations.
His ideas and sentiments were very labile, and a bit
confused, and not all his interpretations dealt with Free
Masons and occultism. August 5, however, the phase of
calmness was again followed by agitation; he broke things
and laughed explosively. August 10, another attack occurred,
with destructiveness. During the next few days there were
alternate phases of depression and excitation. He was negativistic,
resistive and struck attendants.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> war stress and psychoses, Morselli finds the acute cases
on psychopathic soil. First in the list, he places the neurasthenias
and psychasthenias, and second, the hysterias,
two groups which, more than the remainder, may be said to
constitute the so-called Shell-shock group. Third, he found
depressions ranging over into a delusional state with suicidal
ideas; fourth, a species of stupor, occasionally catatonic,
recalling dementia praecox; fifth, transient hallucinatory
states; sixth, confusions (Meynert’s amentia?); last, manias.</p>

<p>The above case of Dumesnil appears to be a pure case of
manic-depressive psychosis developing on the war basis, but
perhaps merely comes from a latent cyclothymia.</p>

<p>A farmer, 30, was mobilized August 2, 1914, and was
wounded in the hand September 27. He went back to his
dépôt in December and stayed there until March, 1915, when
he was sent to Dunkirk. Before leaving the dépôt he said
that he had heard soldiers declaring that he was not doing
his duty, that he was going to be court-martialed, that life
was at an end for him. At Dunkirk he said these same soldiers
continued to say the same things about him, forming
a band about him, led off by a subaltern officer who meant
to frighten him and to make him talk. One night sulphur
was thrown at him for poisoning purposes; he complained of
this to a sergeant and declared he did not understand why
he should be thus pursued. After the bombardment of Dunkirk
the hallucinations grew more intense. He was sent to
hospital and was so harried by the voices that he wanted to
throw himself down a staircase but was caught in time.
At the hospital for the insane he complained that his thoughts
were being heard and loudly repeated; he was made to make
incoördinate movements; was treated as a spy. He thought
he must be a German or they would not treat him so. He
waited for death as he wanted to be executed at once.</p>

<p>This man’s father was alcoholic. He himself at the age
of fourteen had had a period of neurasthenia with some sort
of nervous seizure for a period of five months. At 28 he had
a rheumatic seizure which kept him in bed fifty days. A
daughter born to his wife had died a few days after birth.</p>

due to war stress in a predisposed person.</p>

<p>August 16, 1916, he was admitted to Mott’s wards at

He had improved somewhat in October, but still had periods
of depression. He was put on thyroid extract (Green’s
treatment was in doses measuring from gr. ¼ to gr. 1, t.d.s.;
according to Green, the effect of thyroid extract is more
rapid when coupled with pituitrin). In December he was
given pituitrin extract gr. 2, t.d.s. In January, 1917, he was
no longer depressed or lethargic. He complained of pain in
his back, found to be due to a bullet. This was removed.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> prisoners, Imboden found amongst 20,000 French soldiers
taken prisoner at Verdun after the severest drum fire
and strain, only five neurotic cases (data of Mörchen), and
Wilmanns found but five neurotic cases amongst 80,000
prisoners. Lust reviewed 20,000 war prisoners in Germany
and found singularly few instances of neurosis. Shunkoff
notes, however, that there are a number of psychotic cases
amongst the prisoners because the <i>mentally</i> diseased who do
not disturb the military routine are kept in the line. Bonhoeffer
found amongst Serbians taken prisoners by Germany,
emaciation, atrophy, heart disease, and frequently tuberculosis.
(See <a href="#case166">Case 166</a>.) Bonhoeffer noted the absence of
psychoses amongst these Serbians, drawing the general conclusion
that campaign stress was unable to bring out psychoses.
But, although the exhaustion psychoses are not
found, there are exhaustion neuroses or states of acute nervous
exhaustion, characterized by somnolence and depression,
followed by a mild degree of overemotionality. vum
Busch states that interned German civilians have gone into
psychosis frequently. It is said that one in 10,000 war
prisoners in Germany has committed suicide. Bishop Bury
found at Ruhleben 60 or 70 cases of psychosis.</p>

interested in sports and very sympathetic with English
manners), was about to go to live in the country on the advice
of his physician when the war broke out. He was
called to the colors and shortly lost his tendency to bronchitis,
put on flesh, and felt delighted with his situation.</p>

<p>After almost two years of effective service, June 2, 1916,
when his troop was cautiously advancing into a trench at the
end of which they might be taken by surprise, suddenly the
officer cried, “<i>Sauve qui peut!</i> <i>The Boches are on us!</i>” The
patient remembered seeing Germans emerge from every side,
remembered his fear, how he had turned about and crossed
over a palisade, and then no more until he found a scalp
wound being staunched by his comrades in the trench. He
put on his own dressing and followed his comrades on foot.</p>

<p>He quickly got well of his scalp-wound but remained in
hospital, very weak, extremely impressionable, jumping at
every noise. He got somewhat better with the rest in bed,
though even a month after his hallucination, he had a spell
of insomnia, thinking about his future and the possibility of
a relapse, and having war dreams from which he would awake
in a sweat. Once on awaking, he distinctly heard a voice
saying, “<i>Well, Charles?</i>” This hallucination occurred five
times, under exactly the same circumstances, except that once
it was in the daylight. Adrenalin was given, 1:1000, 10<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
drops the first day, 20 the second, 30 the third, and a like
amount on the following days. After three days of such
treatment, the patient said he felt much better. Later he
had a period in which he had lost self-control and could no
longer take any initiative. Thus, if he wanted to reply to
his mother, it seemed to him that some one not himself was
ordering him to write. He now asked himself if he were not
really dreaming. He would not be sure of his actual existence
unless something happened to prove it, such as the
nurse’s bringing him a plate.</p>

<p>In short as the first phase of diffuse over-emotionality had
been succeeded by a second of obsessions, so the obsessive
phase was succeeded by a third phase of mild loss of the
feeling of reality. The first phase following the wound was
one of disorder of attention, of memory, and in fact of all the
mental functions, associated with tremors, tachycardia and
dizziness. The second phase seemed, as it were, to crystallize
intellectually the anxious apprehensiveness of the first
phase. There were fears that the ceiling would fall; there
were scruples concerning the past; there were fearful premonitions
for the future (such as, that any bomb he might
pick up would burst). According to Laignel-Lavastine and
Courbon, there may have been a predisposition in the vegetative
system of this subject, or even a basis in his tuberculosis,
of which, in fact, the X-ray showed still some slight evidences.
The obsessions appeared at night, at a time, namely, when the
vital rhythm is passing from a sympathotonic period over
into a vagotonic period, at a time when the organic sensations
are apt to swim to the fore. According to this analysis,
these somatic sensations, precisely those that the battlefield
had also brought out, brought out again the other emotions
which he had felt on service. It was always the emotions
first developed in military service that were revived in
the disease. In the third phase, the physical condition of the
patient had grown much better <i>pari passu</i> with disappearance
of the obsessions and the onset of the personality disorder.
The adrenalin raised arterial tension, and going down
to the sympathetic caused the anxiety and war emotions
linked therewith to disappear; but the adrenalin treatment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
according to Laignel-Lavastine and Courbon, disturbed the
organic sensations so suddenly that there was a break between
the new conscious status and the old. In consequence,
the patient felt that these new sensations no longer really
belonged to him but were of a xenic character, imposed upon
him from without in such wise that he continually asked
himself whether he was really dreaming or no. This man
was a constitutional <i>intimiste</i>; a psychasthenic <i>en herbe</i>.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> neurasthenia, Lépine notes that there are transient
and relatively permanent cases. The term is often used to
cover graver disorders, such as various melancholias and
anxieties. As a rule, in France, the neurasthenics are evacuated
for fatigue. There have been a number of cases in
officers, who find themselves unable to make decisions on
the minute and to remember military facts, or perhaps are
unable to make any physical or intelligent effort whatever.
A true neurasthenic, however, ought not to be a confused
person. He is a man with a rather unusual clarity of view
as to his situation; and his trouble appears to him to be
somatic rather than as of the nature of a depression. He
feels that, if he could only rest, he could be cured. Neurasthenia,
according to Lépine’s war experience, is practically
always the disease of a highly cultivated nervous system,
and appears in men who have undertaken responsibilities.
There is a group of young men who have never been physically
strong, bowled over at last by some small event, such
as a diarrhoea, and unable to carry on. Such men, perhaps,
are likely to have some traces of an old tuberculosis, an
adrenal insufficiency, or insufficient hepatic function. Martinet
has found them hypotensive and rather poorly aerated.
There is another group of neurasthenics (Maurice of Fleury)
that are old arthritics, with increased tension. These cases
are not found at the front because conditions there rather
tend to reduce the trouble; but they are found doing office
work in the interior. Besides these cases of the “cultivated”
group, Lépine also finds a number of neurasthenics amongst
the peasants, in whom anxious ideas may lead to hypochondria.</p>

<p>Fugue, hysterical.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 171.</b> (<span class="smcap">Milian</span>, May, 1915.)</h4>

<p>The fugue of an adjutant who left his regimental relief
post at Palameix Farm and was found several days later with
his family at Castelsarrasin, was reconstructed from partial
records as follows:</p>

<p>November 27, 1914, after a night in the trenches, when
two shells burst near him, the adjutant turned up at the
relief post with wild eyes and a complaint of fatigue, and of
an old wound and headaches. The wound he had gotten in
a fight which gained him his grade of adjutant. The physician
prescribed rest. He sat down by the stove, silent and
dejected, and at about four o’clock, in the presence of the
medical assistant, made preparations to go, leaving sack and
saber behind, but taking outer garments and revolver case.
On the way from the farm, he met comrades and told them he
had been evacuated to his dépôt on the colonel’s order, and
walked with them, Indian file, in the midst of falling shells,
the others talking but the adjutant himself silent. At nightfall,
he said, “Good evening,” and parted from them. Of
his further course to his home, all recollection was lost by
the adjutant; in fact, he did not remember anything beyond
the Palameix Farm, where he had seen a comrade wounded
in the head. He got home November 29th, at eight in the
morning. He had most of his money with him, having
traveled by train some distance without a ticket; moreover,
without asking for a ticket, and without having eaten. When
the ticketman in his home town asked him whether he was
back from the war, he looked at him vaguely and went out
without replying; nor did he reply to a newspaper man on
the road home. This was the more strange as he was ordinarily
an affable person.</p>

<p>He had a convulsive crisis at home, after which he was
exhausted and apparently unable to move or reply. A physician
said that he had had a cerebral shock. When the police
arrived, two hours later, he was apparently delirious, saying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
such things as, “<i>The Christians want to shoot me but I know
the rules! Come, boys, stay in the trenches!</i>” “<i>There are two
more dead ones!</i>” etc. During the day he recovered consciousness
and was greatly disturbed at his military crime.</p>

<p>In point of fact, he had had, at the age of 17, analogous
crises, as was certified by Régis, who had cared for him from
1907 to 1909 for hysteria with sudden somnambulistic attacks
and amnesia.</p>

<p>While in prison after his arrest, he also had hysterical
crises with agitation, flushed face, hard attempts to vomit,
respiratory disorder due to interference in the throat (globus
hystericus), and delirious phenomena (“Germans had followed
him home”).</p>

<p>After his birth his mother had had two miscarriages
and a stillborn child. The adjutant was declared irresponsible
and acquitted. This is apparently an instance of
hysteria without stigmata.</p>

<p>Hysterical Adventist.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 172.</b> (<span class="smcap">De la Motte</span>, August, 1915.)</h4>

<p>An engineer, 31, in the Landwehr at the outset of the
campaign, was first put on sentry service in Berlin on the
ground that he was an Adventist. He was later put into the
military service and had difficulty because he did not want
to serve on Sunday. He was shoved from one company to
another. He refused to be inoculated and was arrested
therefor. In the prison, he began to hear God’s voice calling
to him distinctly to tell his fellow-men that the end of this was
going to be the end of all things. Back in the barracks, he
again heard a voice&mdash;“<i>Come forth!</i>”&mdash;“<i>Go!</i>” He went!
He had his revelations then published in the form of tracts,
and held Bible readings day and night among his friends in
Bremen&mdash;looking for the signs of the times in the Bible
sayings. One of his fellow Adventists finally warned the
police, and the military authorities put him under psychiatric
observation. He proved to have numerous stigmata of
hysteria. He talked freely about his visions, and was aware
that he was punishable.</p>

<p>Here, then, was a case of hysterical psychosis, liberated by
military service.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="case173">
<p>Fugue, psychoneurotic.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 173.</b> (<span class="smcap">Logre.</span>)</h4>

<p>The question, Is this escape really a fugue? is brought up
not only in epileptic, alcoholic, and melancholic cases, but
also in cases suggestive of psychoneurosis. A son of an insane
person was subject to what may be called a phobic or
obsessive fugue. The case may be called one of morbid
cowardice and was observed in a soldier in the trenches. In
point of fact, the man had always been an anxious and fearsome
person, given to phobias. He had night terrors and
fear of diseases and death. He was agoraphobic in adolescence,
and had to have a policeman or passerby go with him
through a public place. He had had also suicidal and homicidal
obsessions, and periods of psychoneurotic anxiety.</p>

<p>This man’s sojourn at the front put his morbid personality
to a cruel test. He was soon known by all in the trenches as
a <i>froussard</i>. He had a terrible fear of the guns, jumped,
grew pale, trembled, complained of palpitations, lumps in
the throat, etc. He was the laughing-stock of his comrades;
but according to the patient himself, he was more afraid of
his own emotion than of the shells, although his comrades
couldn’t understand it. He was employed as a kitchenman,
in a post not much exposed. A more resolute comrade
helped him to escape, escaping also himself, thus bringing up
the problem of <i>fugue á deux</i>. Limited responsibility was
decided for the case, although the fugue had been aided by his
morbid anxiety. Of course, his place was not in the trenches
at all. He was condemned to two years in prison. After
his sentence, he was given a chance to rehabilitate himself by
sending him again to the trenches, but he had to be evacuated
a few weeks later on account of his increasing emotionality.</p>

<p>Shell-shy; war bride pregnant: Fugue with amnesia
and mutism.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 174.</b> (<span class="smcap">Myers</span>, January, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A rifleman, 30 years old, was brought to a casualty clearing
station, looking like an imbecile, with a history of having
wandered about aimlessly, not knowing where he was or what
he was doing. On questioning, he remained absolutely
speechless and terrified. Four days later, in conversation
with Major Myers, he was got to speak in a faint voice about
his wife, home, and occupation, saying that the month was
October (when it was actually August) and that he had been
in France two months, when it was actually twelve. He
described emotionally certain trench scenes, and then thought
of his wife sewing.</p>

<p>Hypnotized, he remembered going into a dug-out after
running away from shells; he was made to talk in a loud voice.
Next day, during hypnosis, proper orientation for time reappeared.
He was got to write an ordinary soldier’s letter
to his wife. The following day he was active, making beds,
but was mute (there was a case of mutism in the same ward).
Under hypnosis speech returned. He had gone to a horse
show, and upon his return, something hit his back; shells had
begun to fall. Found hiding in a shack, he was carried to a
hospital in an ambulance. After this hypnotic treatment,
the power of speech was maintained, although his voice became
faint or failed whenever he was asked about the incidents
described above. Next day he waked speaking normally,
nudging his neighbor and asking, “Is it me that’s talking?”
He had before appeared dull and depressed, but now appeared
an intelligent, agreeable, and garrulous fellow. It appears
that his wife was a war bride and he had heard some months
since that she was pregnant. He had been troubled, thinking
she was in money difficulties and kept thinking about a
friend whose wife had lost her first baby. Recovery appears
to be complete except for occasional headaches, and the
patient is now serving in his reserve battalion.</p>

<p>A neurasthenic volunteer.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 175.</b> (<span class="smcap">E. Smith</span>, June, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A man who volunteered for service at the outbreak of the
war (he had recently been an inmate of a sanatorium) was
sent back to England as neurasthenic after three trying
months at the front. The case sheet read that he was subject
to dazed conditions. In hospital he suffered from insomnia,
and before his slight periods of sleep he constantly had visions
of two comrades who had been terribly lacerated at his side.
These hallucinations in their reality aroused in him a fear
that he was insane.</p>

<p>There were also terrifying dreams, beginning with episodes
at the front and ending with sex experiences. These dreams
were ended by seminal emissions. These formed a second
cause for the patient’s belief that he was insane, as he said he
remembered literature read as a boy concerning spermatorrhoea.</p>

<p>In the treatment of this case the writings of psychologists
who had studied hypnagogic experiences were used and the
absence of hallucinations during waking hours was stressed.
The remembered literature regarding spermatorrhoea was
discounted by the rational explanation of his state.</p>

<p>He seemed to be getting on well when a trivial accident
caused a relapse. While he was saying goodby to his wife,
who had visited him, she was taken ill, and he went home
with her. He was punished for being late in returning to the
hospital. Although no moral stigma attaches to confinements
in barracks in most soldiers’ minds, in this man a
depression was produced and suicidal talk followed. It
seems that his father had been sent to jail when he was a child,
and he felt he had been tainted by his father in such wise that
his “criming” was due to heredity. With the removal of
this misconception he became more rational and immensely
improved.</p>

<p>A 38-year old soldier is Jolly’s example of a neurasthenia

hereditary factors. This soldier had been a moderately good
student and never ill. He went into the battle line in December,
1914, and came out in May, 1915, on account of exhaustion.
The case is not wholly convincing since the
patient had a shrapnel injury of the skull, described as of so
inconsiderable a degree that he was not put on the sick list
on its account. The patient finally arrived at the Nuremberg
Hospital, complaining of pressure in the head, as if there was
a band around the head, and dizziness. He wept a good deal
saying that the sight of the dead had frightened him. Sleep
was restless and there were unpleasant dreams of the battle
field. Intelligence was not in any degree disturbed. The
supra-orbital points were sensitive to pressure. The tongue
showed a marked tremor and was coated; the mechanical
excitability of the muscles was increased; and there was
reddening of the skin on stroking. There was a fine tremor
of the extended fingers, less tremor of the head and of the
body at large. Knee-jerks normal. Nutrition well preserved.
Partial recovery in the hospital.</p>

<p>Importance of arterial hypotension in the diagnosis
of psychasthenia.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 177.</b> (<span class="smcap">Crouzon</span>, March, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A man of 32 (never well, with general weakness, ideas of
consumption and vacuous thinking following a good recovery
from bronchitis at 28, unsuccessful in business, subject to
weaknesses) had had eighteen months antebellum of what
might be called psychasthenia. There were spells of loss of
consciousness without convulsions, and probably of hysterical
nature. There had been for two years insomnia and a general
hypobulic slowing down of work.</p>

<p>In military service the crises became more frequent,
coming two or three times a week. Tuberculosis could not
be shown, nor was there any organic lesion of the nervous
system. The arterial tension (Potain sphygmomanometer)
stood at 11.</p>

<p>According to Crouzon, arterial hypotension is an objective
sign tending to assure the organic nature of a psychasthenia.
Whereas simple neurasthenics are hypertensive, others have
long been recognized as hypotensive; but heart experts have
recognized this asthenic hypotension more than psychiatrists
or neurologists. In differential diagnosis it is necessary to
consider and exclude the early hypotensions of pulmonary
tuberculosis and those of Addison’s disease. This hypotension
is most frequently observed in constitutional neurasthenics
and psychasthenics. Hypertensive drugs, adrenalin,
tincture of colchicum, have produced a transitory improvement
in a number of cases, but the amelioration has halted
with the stoppage of the drugs.</p>

<p>A man, 29, after some months’ service (three months in
France and later in Salonica) was invalided for backache,
insomnia, and enuresis. It seems that this married man had
never done any work after leaving school at 18, having substantial
private means. He had been married for 3½ years,
had a son, and was, according to Eder, perhaps morbidly
attached to his wife and child. He had been a sportsman
and was selected for sniping work in France. The son of a
shipbuilder, he had always planned all kinds of ships and
engines, never to be used. After seeing the world, he was
about to enter his father’s business when he had to take care
of his father in a nervous breakdown. After a second attack,
the man never entered business.</p>

<p>February 6, 1916, wide-spread patchy analgesia and lumbar
hyperesthesia were found. He thought sluggishly, being
restless and holding attention poorly. He began twenty
letters, destroying each after finishing a few lines. He was
shy and felt that everybody was looking at him. He became
speechless if he had to address his commanding officer.
He had an obsession to mark each flagstone and touch
each post, and various counting and arranging obsessions.</p>

<p>The <i>Horme</i> (Jung) was elusive. A dream: “I was in a
cargo boat in the river; we were steering straight into ferry
and harbor. The pilot rang down ‘Full speed to stern’; I
pushed him out of the way, and rang down ‘Full speed ahead,
two points to starboard.’ We went straight past ferry and
harbor without accident.” Again, a few days later, “In a
motor car, came to some rocks which sprang up in front of
me. The machine broke down. I abandoned it and clambered
over the rocks. It was tough work. My object was
a ship. I got to the ship, took hold of the wrench, and
signalled ‘Let go.’” Herein, according to Eder, are certain
obvious symbolic conversions.</p>

<p>Antebellum attacks, with dizziness: Fainting on
horseback. Neurasthenia.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 179.</b> (<span class="smcap">Binswanger</span>, July, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A harness-maker, 37, a corporal, was called to the colors
on the second day of mobilization. He was attacked by a
slight dizziness in the evening (see previous history below).
He went into the field on August 7 and had repeated attacks
of dizziness, despite which he took part in several skirmishes.
He could not ride on horseback, since dizziness, ringing in the
ears, headaches, and trembling of the whole body would
develop. October 27 a severe fainting attack came while he
was sitting on a horse. He woke ten hours later, vomited
several times and felt dazed. Two weeks later hearing in
the right ear began to be impaired. During several transfers
from hospital to hospital near the East front, there were two
more severe attacks of dizziness and vomiting. Brought
back to Germany, the patient finally came to the Jena
Hospital, May 20.</p>

<p>The estimate of this case depends somewhat on the previous
history. He appears to have come from a healthy family,
was married, and had two healthy children. His bodily and
mental development had been normal; he had been an unusually
good scholar, but he stammered from his tenth year
without apparent reason. He had had treatment in an
institution for stammerers at 17, achieving a complete cure
in six weeks. His military service was as a cavalryman,
1897-1900, after which he had married. There was no excess
in alcohol; he was not a smoker. From his own account, he
had always been somewhat nervous, had trembled easily,
and had fallen to stammering when excited. In 1913 there
had occurred, after physical exertion, three violent attacks of
fainting, with dizziness, vomiting, and excessive perspiration,
each attack lasting from two to three hours. However, from
that time to just before the war, he had been free from attacks.</p>

<p>On examination at the Jena Hospital, the patient complained
of general weariness, a feeling of pressure in the back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
of his head, a hammering all over the head, ringing in the
right ear, impairment of hearing in this ear, a feeling of
dizziness on raising the head, palpitation of heart, especially
at night, occasional trembling of the whole body, and absolute
inability to walk.</p>

<p>The man was slenderly built, of medium height, in moderate
nutrition; pale of face and mucosae; pulse small, regular,
and 114. Neurologically, the deep reflexes were generally
increased, and the skin reflexes decreased. Percussion on
the back of the head elicited marked pain. There were no
pressure points. The movements of the arms were free;
there was a marked tremor of both hands, more marked on the
right. The left grasp was 45, the right, 20, by the dynamometer.</p>

<p>When lying upon his back, the patient could move his
legs, but he moved them only slowly and with tremor. The
heel-to-knee test was successfully executed despite the
tremor; nor could it be demonstrated that there was a
genuine ataxia. Placed upon his feet, he would collapse,
nor could he be made to walk at all. With trunk supported,
he was able to make only a few unsuccessful attempts to drag
the feet forward.</p>

<p>Associated with this apparent paralysis, the sensitiveness
to touch had entirely ceased in the legs, as well as sensitiveness
to pain. The zone of analgesia, however, was more
extensive than the anesthesia, spreading upwards three or
four cm. farther in front. Ticking of the watch could not be
heard even at the meatus of the right ear, although hearing
of the left ear was entirely normal; bone transmission on the
left side. Whispers could be heard close to the meatus. On
speaking, the patient stammered in starting sentences.</p>

<p>He looked extremely anxious during the first few days in
the Jena wards, claiming that he could not raise himself.
When his trunk was raised, he would let himself sink feebly
back into dorsal decubitus. However, when believing himself
unobserved, he was found to be able to move himself in
bed somewhat quickly. He was able to get a box from beneath
the bed, to open the drawer of the night-stand, and to
take remarkable care of his moustachios. He complained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
more and more of headache, though his appetite and sleep
were good. He was often irritable.</p>

<p>Treatment at first consisted of cold packs of the legs twice
a day, salt-water baths, active and passive exercises of the
legs in the position of dorsal decubitus. The patient declaimed
against this treatment. There was slight improvement
after a week of treatment. He was then able to raise
himself in bed, seat himself on the edge of the bed, and stand
without support, all the time, however, groaning and moaning.
After a few moments, he would fall back on the bed,
complaining of violent headache and dizziness. While standing,
both legs trembled.</p>

Upon hospital examination he was very variable in mood,
rather hostile in attitude, and at the same time suggestible.

and had no longer any sign of neurotic disorder. He still
maintained that his memory was weak, although in point of
fact his memory was very good and quick. He could narrate
all the facts about his neurasthenic state. The man’s complaints
were out of all proportion to any demonstrable somatic
disorder. He was discharged, cured, to be put to work at
shoemaking, with the diagnosis, neurasthenia. This neurasthenic
state developed after antityphoid injection.</p>

<p>Neurasthenia (monosymptomatic: Sympathy with

<h4><b>Case 181.</b> (<span class="smcap">Steiner</span>, October, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A non-commissioned reserve officer, 26, in civil life a merchant,
had a strong hereditary taint, having been also in
peace times very nervous and on that account obliged to
give up his studies. At the age of 14, he had seen a man
fall down from a roof and was much excited about it.</p>

<p>At the beginning of mobilization he suffered a functional
aphonia for a few days. He could not let his men shoot at
the enemy because of an idea that occurred forcibly to him:
that the enemy’s soldiers had wives and children! He felt
badly on this account. Later he had a constant taste of
blood in his mouth and a smell of corpses in his nose. Toward
nightfall all these symptoms would change for the worse,
and the symptoms would become especially bad whenever
he had anything to do with the wounded. He tended to
weep much and was easily frightened and had also various
physical symptoms of neurasthenia.</p>

exposure to shell-proof tunnel.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 182.</b> (<span class="smcap">Steiner</span>, October, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A colleague of Steiner, an army physician, 35 years of age,
with strong hereditary taint, having two sick sisters (one
dementia praecox), had been incapacitated for work through
a neurasthenia a few months before mobilization. However,
at first he felt very well, marching through Belgium and into
Northern France.</p>

<p>On the night of the 17th of October, 1914, a shell struck the
house next where he was and startled him up out of sleep.
After that, especially at nightfall, upon entering a cellar he
would have the feeling of the ceiling falling down, and he
would go restlessly from one space to another. Afterwards,
any closed room, however secure or distant from the front
and free from shells, would give him the feeling of the ceiling
about to fall down. He could no longer sit quietly anywhere,
but walked about and avoided the company of others.</p>

<p>A characteristic observation is the following as described by
the physician himself: There was an absolutely shell-proof
tunnel running to the position at the front where he was on
duty. It took about 25 minutes to go through the tunnel,
but on account of his feelings he could not bring himself to
use this tunnel but walked over the exposed hill which was
frequently shelled. Curiously enough, after the appearance
of the first symptoms, a shell exploded nearby without any
marked psychical effect. This happened about noon. The
obsessions were stronger in the evening. Objectively, there
were neurasthenic symptoms of a bodily nature; there was
vasomotor excitability. He was depressed, wept easily, and
showed lack of decision; he had tormenting thoughts that he
had not fulfilled his duty.</p>

Derby War Hospital from Netley.</p>

<p>September 11, 1916, he had been admitted to Number 3
General Hospital, France, in a noisy, excited, insolent state:
said he saw spirits of the dead; heard his sister urging him to
lead a better life. Admitted to Netley early in October, 1916:
now said he was a spiritualist, a Frenchman, had a quarrel
with parents and enlisted in British Army, in army service;
went to France August 12, 1914, was wounded at Loos, September,
1915, returned to front in February, 1916, “shell-shocked”
June 1, 1916; lost consciousness after this&mdash;did
not know where he was until July 22, 1916, when he had
been arrested as deserter.</p>

<p>Admitted to Lord Derby Hospital October 14, 1916,&mdash;quiet,
orderly, coöperative: desired to return to his regiment.
He now gave a history: Enlisted British Army 1908, went to
France, August, 1914, wounded February, 1915, at Neuve
Chapelle; recovered; then attached to 45th Durham Light
Infantry; blown up July 22, 1916, came to August 5, 1916,
in hospital in Boulogne; then back to his regiment&mdash;but
month later left without leave to pay off old score on a former
comrade who had insulted his sister&mdash;arrested later by
military police; put under observation in 65th Field Ambulance.
No deterioration noted, school knowledge fairly well
retained; no hallucinations or delusions (maintained he was
a spiritualist, also that following shell-shock had suffered from
insomnia and seemed to hear sister’s voice). Physically&mdash;small,
well nourished, effeminate looking.</p>

<p>Oct. 23, 1916, he broke parole, but a month later returned

Pembroke Dock. On account of drunken habits, quarreled
again; joined army at Bristol, 1908. Went to France in
August, 1914; January, 1915, invalided home because of
“trench feet”&mdash;discharged as unfit. Reënlisted June, 1915,

nothing until brought to No. 3 General Hospital. He
remembers being accused of desertion but sentence was not
passed, as he was held by the medical officer to have been
irresponsible (as a matter of fact he was, at that time,
considered to be a case of dementia praecox.)</p>

<p>Said that during twenty-five days, due to drunkenness, his
friends had taken him to Manchester with them; arrested by
police as he attempted to get back to hospital. He was now
accused of wilfully lying and, confronted with his police
record, at first denied it, but later gave following approximately
true story:</p>

<p>Born, England, 1890; early life of a roving disposition,
good at school, liked books of adventure. Drank early.

of drunkenness. Three-year sentence to reformatory
in 1910 for stealing: escaped. Rearrested for
stealing in 1911: released in 1913, enlisted in army and deserted.
Arrested in January, 1914, for stealing; sentenced
to three years: released to rejoin army in June, 1915.
Arrested as deserter: imprisoned but released in January,
1916; left for France. August, 1916, “shell-shocked,” sent
to Field Ambulance No. 3, General Hospital, Netley, and
Lord Derby War Hospital. Court-martialed for desertion:

pulmonary, grandfather alcoholic, cousin insane; patient
himself anemic as a boy, victim of chronic gastritis and
gonorrhea), was evacuated from the front to Chateaugiron in
March, 1916. It appeared that instead of watching over his
men as a sergeant should, he gave utterance to baroque
theories of the divine right, the influence of the grace of God
on man, and the end of the war. He went so far as to ask
leave to transmit to the Inventions Bureau of the War
Ministry an invention with respect to the problem of locomotion,
and he sent to the King of Belgium a manuscript to
the effect that he had received from heaven a mission to
reëstablish the world’s balance. He was, in fact, the victim
of delusions of a mystical nature with visual hallucinations.
To explain his mission, he wrote, “It was my duty to take
supreme command of war operations.… I have the power,
the right and the duty to give the following order …
general armistice … peace will be symbolized by the house
undivided and will be constituted by general Christian religious

<h4><b>Case 185.</b> (<span class="smcap">Dumesnil</span>, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A sergeant, aged 23, evacuated from the front to a hospital
for the insane, had been mute, though not deaf, since February
28, 1915. If asked to cry out he grew black in the face
and could utter only a raucous scream which made everyone
jump. He wrote very frequently, stating in February that
as he was still a sergeant and had no hope of advancement,
he cared nothing more for life. “The idea of death got
anchored in my head.” In this state of mind, on the afternoon
of the 27th two bombs came. “I saw the first one
coming and cried out a warning. Coming back I saw the
second one. The bombs were coming rather softly. From
this moment on and up to the time when they burst, I thought
I had gone, that I had been carried off and crushed. I was
quite astounded at finding myself covered with earth and
stones … but I could not talk any more, I could just say
in a low voice ‘Papa,’ and the next day in an ambulance I
could not talk at all.”</p>

<p>There was complete pharyngeal anesthesia. The man had
been a foundling and was clearly a degenerate. He had
always been of a depressed disposition and given to thoughts
about his misfortunes. Over and above the mutism gradually
ideas of persecution and revindication developed (such
as that he merited adjutant’s rank and was being mocked and
treated as a simulator). He drew up a long letter to the War
Ministry in which he stated his desire to be sent back to the
front. He complained to the police about a hospital sergeant
and offered a duel in an elaborate and inflammatory style,
“with whatever weapons shall please you, either sabre of
1845, revolver of 1902 or bayonet of 1886 or the <i>chassepot</i>.
One of us two must disappear.” He had become dangerous
enough to be interned and in hospital remained mute with the
same ideas of persecution and revindication, the same alternate
phases of calmness and excitation. According to Dumesnil:
hysterical mutism with persecutory delusional psychosis.</p>

<p>An Italian peasant began to feel sick on being called to
arms. Antebellum he had been an even-tempered, good-natured
man, according to his own story, satisfied even with
stale food, and always enjoying his sleep. He had been in
the war about a month, doing construction work, sentry duty,
and chores. Though he lived in the trenches under damp
conditions, there had really not been much excessive war
strain. He shortly developed migraine and war-weariness,
as well as middle-ear disease.</p>

<p>A number of times he heard shooting nearby, and was subject
in his sentry duty to a good deal of anxiety and painful
associations. On sentry duty he had digestive disorder,
vomited, and became intolerably weary; in point of fact, a
fever, regarded as malarial, then developed, together with
diarrhea.</p>

<p>Upon hospital observation, he was found fatigued, given
to terrible dreams, tremulous in the fingers, with skin reflexes
a little excessive, and the Moebius phenomenon. The
thyroid was somewhat swollen. The pulse stood at 80.
The Mannkopf sign was well marked, as well as that of
Thomayer (80-120), and Erben (120-87). The oculocardiac
reflex was prominent.</p>

after but one severe day in the trenches, woke and found his
night clothes soaked in urine. Another time, his comrade had
awakened him because he was gnashing his teeth in his sleep.
Again, his grief became very violent at learning of his wife’s
infidelity, and during the night he bit his finger. He thereafter
suffered from severe headaches, dizziness and vertigo
though without falling. He was granted a furlough, but the
condition was aggravated on account of his wife’s abandonment
of him, and one day, finding her with her lover, he threw
himself at them, wounding her severely in the face: he did not
remember this impulse later. Many hours later, on awakening
in prison with his wounded hand, he recalled the entire
episode. He showed a confused and excited condition,
which, however, quickly diminished. He became lucid and
tranquil, though easily aroused. He cried at the thought of
his daughter, whom he wanted to save. Insomnia, instability
of reaction, habitual migraine, and dizziness. Tremors
of the fingers and of the eyelids. Exaggerated reflexes. Very

his sword and threw three bottles at the host.
Bystanders overpowered him and carried him to the local
police station. Handcuffs were put on to stop the mania.
His pupils were dilated and he was sweating profusely.
Alcohol could absolutely be excluded from the history of this
incident.</p>

<p>Observed in clinic, the patient was rather silent, but on
the whole normal and without delusions or hallucinations.
It seems that he had committed a number of crimes in the
army that were always excused on account of his mental state.
He had been strongly alcoholic, although not at the time of
the incident mentioned. He was covered with tattooings of
an obscene and violent nature.</p>

<p>He showed pharyngeal and conjunctival anesthesia and
concentric limitation of the visual fields of unusual degree,

chattering and presumptuous, and often very vulgar in talk
and manner. He had tried several trades, with little success.</p>

<p>While in the army he discharged his gun three times, claiming
to have heard noises in a nearby field. On account of the
inopportune repeated discharges, he was condemned to the
barracks for ten days. The following day, instead of returning
to the barracks, he abandoned his musket, cartridge box
and uniform, and, returning to town, left for Leghorn. Being
sent to prison, he began to scream that he was thirsty. He
tore his jacket into strips with his teeth, and making a noose
of it, attempted to hang himself.</p>

<p>On being transferred to the military hospital, he was often
very restless, screaming and making a great uproar. On
being questioned, he answered indifferently and had a vacant
stare. During his stay at the clinic, patient was always
quiet. Once, however, he had a spell of intense psycho-motor
agitation, brought on without any known cause and

<p>September 23, 1914, the patient, who had been reproved
by a superior officer to whom he had given a disrespectful
answer, began to be excitable. He was calm during the day,
but acted in a sullen and gloomy way and kept entirely to
himself, avoiding even his most intimate friends. When,
however, he suddenly recalled his punishment of the morning,
he began to race around the yard and finally threw himself
upon the ground, remaining there in a cowering and squatting
position. At the beginning of the attack he was possessed
of a paroxysm of fury, which made a great impression upon
those present: eyes agape, face swollen and distorted. He
resisted being transferred to the hospital and a furious
struggle followed. He tried to bite and scratch everyone.
It required ten persons to carry him by his hands and feet
safely to the hospital, where he arrived in a state of great
excitement and rage.</p>

him to go out into the country a distance of some 20 kilometers
from the front, with the definite object of praying in
a certain church. It seems that this same impulse had
occurred to him several times before but not so forcibly.
These prayers were to be said in memory of some sad events
in his life.</p>

<p>Upon examination he was found in a sad and self-accusatory
state, much discouraged with ideas of his guilt, unworthiness,
and ruin. He had a variety of gloomy fears and
obsessions, all of which contributed to the dromomania that

the dark; as a youth wanted to throw himself down from
heights; took delight in seeing animals killed; was shy with
both sexes; was never able to run great distances; was taken
from school at the age of fifteen for weakness, and had always
been subject to headaches, somewhat improved by lenses.</p>

<p>During training sharp pains appeared in the left groin that
grew better when the man lay down. These pains were
regarded as hysterical. Thereafter began shortness of breath,
pain above the heart, with palpitations and occasional attacks
of dizziness. After a short sick leave he insisted upon going
to the front, though his superior officer thought it unwise,
and, after a period of seventeen months training, was finally
sent to France in September, 1916.</p>

<p>He was at first somewhat afraid of shells and, though he
soon got used to the shells, the horror of the war grew on him,
with pity for the Germans as much as for the British. He
became depressed over his weakness and when his commanding
officer committed suicide got obsessed with the idea of
committing suicide himself. He went so far as to drive a
knife into his upper lip and to smash a looking-glass to avoid
seeing himself. After a long spell of trench duty he had to
be sent home incapacitated.</p>

<p>In hospital in England he was depressed and suicidal.
He began to want to mutilate himself, yet found that a slight
pain and the drawing of blood was all that he really craved.
Of course, he had been a failure, but now he rationalized the
failure by a comfortable conviction that he should never have
been sent to the front. He complained of memory and
attention disorder, insisted that he was physically incapable
of outdoor exercise, complained of headache if he stayed
indoors. He said he wanted to go back to the front; knew,
however, that he could not, and even refused to consider the
possibility of getting well to work at home. At the time of
report he argued there was nothing left but suicide.</p>

evacuated in November. One afternoon, at the end of a

felt a dreamy, bizarre feeling, as if a fog lay between
him and his surroundings. Next day, after a good night,
he woke in the same state. Everything was bizarre and
novel despite the fact that he recognized men and things.
A physician ordered rest and after a few days evacuated him.</p>

<p>He was cared for in various hospitals, but the psychasthenia
increased. He felt a terrible and causeless anguish,
with precordial constriction. He felt as if he were about
to be executed. His fears appeared after seeing some turning
object, such as a wheel or a cane twirling. Gradually
this fear was transformed into a genital excitation, though
lascivious pictures did not excite him. Seeing anything
turning gave him a voluptuous feeling in proportion to the
speed of the rotation. It seems that all sexual interest
had been at a standstill for several months in the early
part of his disease, when suddenly this new aberration
appeared. It seems that a portion of the man’s work in the
artillery caused him to use screws and cogwheels every
day. Attacks of vertigo occurred, with the appearance of an
infinity of small, colorless spheres turning over one another,
the whole forming a sort of animated system of rotation.
In the night this system was luminous and somewhat like
what one feels on compressing the globes of the eye. There
was a retraction of the visual field. The man would be found
in the dream state, especially after waking in the morning
or when some novel kind of act was being performed. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
got somewhat better and did not wish to go on leave, because
he feared the recurrence of these psychasthenic paroxysms.
However, he took a leave July 14th. In the first
part of his journey he had some vertigo and some of the
voluptuous sensations, but in the next two days he was
much better. He returned to hospital without trouble.</p>

<p>The authors somewhat doubtfully term this case one of a
quiet psychasthenia, but in discussion still further talk arose
as to the diagnosis.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> psychasthenics, Lépine notes that the lack of any out-standing
symptoms in many psychasthenics allows them to
stay in the army longer than would epileptics or hysterics
of the same degree of disease. The line officers tend to
consider them exaggerators or simulators. The fact that
they besiege the line officers and the physicians with their
troubles may add to the impression of falsification. The
basis of the psychasthenia is often also, genuinely enough, a
fear. Lépine divides the military cases into anxiety neuroses
and hypochondrias. The anxiety cases are hypotensive
and given to tachycardia. They have very labile
vasomotors. When it comes to the necessary exclusion of
malingering, it is the history, with its hereditary and collateral
taint, that tells the tale. A history in the patient
himself of alcoholism, typhoid fever, syphilis, or especially
cranial trauma may play a part. An agoraphobic may actually
be in general a courageous man except for his crises of
anxiety about open spaces.</p>

<p>As to the hypochondriacs, fear of syphilis must be noted.
Akin to the syphilophobics are a group of pseudo genitourinary
cases that fear effects of an old gonorrhoea. See

<p>Gonorrhoea: NOSOPHOBIA, depression, suicidal

</div>

<h4><b>Case 195.</b> (<span class="smcap">Colin</span> and <span class="smcap">Lautier</span>, July, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A munition worker came to Villejuif, December 6, 1915,
with cord marks on his neck and conjunctival ecchymoses.
He had tried to hang himself.</p>

<p>Non-alcoholic, he had, however, long since shown signs of
imbalance; his father had died insane, in an institution.
When the man came in, he wept and groaned and made
vague complaints of having contracted a venereal disease,
insisting that his genital organs were purple.</p>

<p>After a few days, he grew less anxious and told how he was
married and how his wife had made life a hell for him, giving
herself up to drink and becoming a sloven; how several
months since he had contracted gonorrhoea; how though
told that the condition was cured, he had found filaments in
the urine and had tried a variety of drugs, spending most of
his money; how he found more and more filaments, thought
himself incurable and unable to live with his wife; how at
last, desperate, he had tried to hang himself.</p>

<p>He got well quickly, though his convalescence was interrupted
by several periods of depression a few days in
duration, with anxiety and tears. February, 1916, he was
discharged well.</p>

<p>He returned four months later; he was still occupied with
his disease, still going to physicians and buying drugs. It
took six months more before the man could be discharged
from the service, at the end of 1916.</p>

<p>This man appears to be a hereditarily predisposed subject,
who simply affixed his delusional ideas to a disease which had
begun some time before the mental trouble itself. The family
plight is important and practically constant in this group
of cases. The fear lest the disease shall be revealed by the
physician to the family is deep-grounded and impossible
to overcome by mere statements concerning professional
secrecy. The impulse to suicide is extraordinarily keen.</p>

<h4><b>Case 196.</b> (<span class="smcap">Lattes</span> and <span class="smcap">Goria</span>, 1917.)</h4>

<p>An Italian soldier (a shoemaker with an epileptic mother
and two nervous brothers; himself always irritable and for
long periods melancholic; at 15 condemned to nine years
in prison for homicide in a quarrel) took part in a number
of attacks at the beginning of the war. His company
was heavily engaged in October, 1915, and there was no sleep
two nights, and only a bit of cold food. He was dazed.</p>

<p>October 24, the company had to advance at night in the
rain and under a heavy rifle fire. The shoemaker stumbled
over a corpse, fell, and lost consciousness for a time that
he thought was very long. He woke up in a camp hospital,
remembering all the experiences he had undergone up to
the time of losing consciousness. He now fell into a state
of torpor, occasionally jumping out of bed and shouting with
fear, hurling himself at non-existent persons, assuming a
position of defence, and suddenly awaking in anxiety.</p>

<p>October 29, he was transferred to a second hospital, and
October 30, in a third hospital, was examined and found
well and strongly built, but looking prematurely old. He
was inactive, depressed, and stuporous looking. He fell to
weeping often and rarely gave any answer to questions.
Sometimes he refused food. There was a slight paresis of
the left arm, and the left pupil was smaller than the right;
both pupils reacted poorly to light. The larynx and cornea
did not respond to stimulation. Skin reflexes were poor,
and the plantar reflex lacking. The left side about the
shoulder and hip showed large patches of anesthesia to touch,
pain and heat; but deep sensibility was present in these
areas. He slept well at night. Status unchanged for two
weeks. He was experimentally sent to the guardhouse, but
was soon back in hospital with the same symptoms as ever.</p>

<h4><b>Case 197.</b> (<span class="smcap">Mott</span>, November, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A soldier became rather nervous at the Somme, and later
underwent intense bombardment for some four hours, February
22, 4 to 8 P.M. Although he said he “could not
stand it much longer” he carried on for twelve hours more
when perhaps six shells went over, February 23. One of
the shells burst about ten feet away, just behind the dugout.
The first day of the bombardment he was tremulous and
depressed; later coarsely tremulous in the limbs. February
23 there was crying and inability to walk or do any sort of
work. Questions were not answered. The pupils were
dilated. The evening of February 23 the man was admitted
to the field ambulance in acute mania, shouting: “Keep
them back! Keep them back!” He was quieted with morphine
and chloroform and slept well during the night. There
were at least two hypodermic injections of morphine in the
ambulance. He woke up the morning of February 24 apparently
well, but suddenly died.</p>

<p>The autopsy showed small scratches on the anterior chest
wall, but otherwise no sign of external violence. Both lungs
were edematous; the left lower lobe showed a considerable
hemorrhage. The heart was enlarged and the right side
dilated. The liver was somewhat congested. The kidneys
were small, but otherwise showed no gross change (urine
without sugar or albumin).</p>

<p>The scalp showed a slight frontal bruise. The brain was
extremely congested. On each side of every superficial
vessel there was an ecchymosis. A number of minute
punctate hemorrhages was found on the surface of the
brain in connection with very small vessels. The brain
substance was soft, but not markedly edematous. The
cerebrospinal fluid was tinged with blood. On each side of
the great sinuses of the skull there was considerable ecchymosis.
This examination was made by Capt. A. Stokes,
R.A.M.C., in the mobile laboratory. There were no areas of
large hemorrhage anywhere in the brain substance and no
smaller petechiae, except the superficial ones above noted.</p>

<p>Microscopically Mott confirmed the pial congestion and
macroscopic subpial hemorrhages described in the gross. He
found besides congestion also actual hemorrhage in the vascular
sheaths of the corpus callosum, internal capsule, pons
and bulb. Now and then blood corpuscles were found extravasated
into the nervous tissue.</p>

<p>The microscopic examination showed a generalized early
chromatolysis in the nerve cells of varying intensity, especially
affecting the small cells. The Nissl granules of the
larger cells were also somewhat abnormal, being smaller and
packed rather loosely together.</p>

<p>The small cells of the bulb and pons were slightly swollen
and their nuclei large and clear. As to the larger cells of the
bulb and pons, there was less evidence of this swelling and
nuclear change.</p>

<p>According to Mott, this chromatolysis may perhaps be regarded
as a sign of loss of biochemical neuropotential.
The chromatolysis indicates a relative degree of exhaustion
of the kinetoplasm. Mott assumes that the cells of this
victim of shell-shock are in a state of beginning nervous
exhaustion. He remarks that the cells of the vago-accessorius
nucleus show more signs of this nervous exhaustion
than others. With respect to cerebellar findings Mott remarks
that the changes found are very similar to those
described by Crile in the case of an exhausted and wounded
soldier. Mott correlates the mania shown on the evening of
February 23 with the venous congestion of the cortex, the
small subpial hemorrhages and evidence of scattered arterio-capillary
collapse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>Mott suggests that the sudden death of the case may be
due to a hemorrhage into a sheath of a fair-sized vessel in
the median raphe of the bulb; the general venous congestion;
and the almost complete chromatolysis of the vago-accessorius
nucleus (adjacent hypoglossal nucleus normal).</p>

<p>According to Mott, also, many Shell-shock symptoms, <i>e.g.</i>,
headache, giddiness, amnesia (anterograde and retrograde),
dizzy feelings, lack of power of attention, and fatigue, stupor,
inertia, mental confusion, terrifying dreams, are to be explained
on the basis of capillary anemia and chromatolytic
changes.</p>

</div>

<h4><b>Case 198.</b> (<span class="smcap">Chavigny</span>, January, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A sergeant in a Chasseur Battalion was in a mine explosion
and entered hospital June 19, 1915, so agitated that he
had to be tied to the stretcher during transfer from the
railway. There were remains of epistaxis and blood in the
right ear, not proved to be due to otorrhagia; blue-black
ecchymoses of both eyelids; and small ecchymoses of the
bulbar conjunctiva of the right eye. No other sign of
trauma or fracture. The explosion had probably taken
place on June 17 or 18. Patient was but semiconscious and
irresponsive; rolled upon the mattress, beating the air with
arms and legs, assuming fighting postures and uttering cries.
Urinary incontinence. No fever.</p>

<p>There was doubt as to the diagnosis, which lay between
fracture and concussion. The persistent agitation and oniric
delirium pointed rather to concussion. Without further
sign, however, the patient died on the night of June 20.</p>

<p>The autopsy was extremely careful and showed no sign of
cranial fracture of vault or base. The cerebrospinal fluid
was strongly bloodstained. The inner surface of the dura
mater had a thin sheet of hemorrhage, hardly 1 mm. thick,
covering both hemispheres and the cerebellum and spreading
over the bulb. There was no distension of the lateral ventricles.
Serial sections of the brain showed no lesions of
the substance, except for slight hemorrhagic points.</p>

<p>According to Chavigny, so slight a meningeal hemorrhage
is incapable of producing a mechanical disturbance of the
brain and the cause of death could not be said to be meningeal
hemorrhage. Massive multiple gas embolism through
sudden decompression is not a suitable explanation of a case
with death delayed, as in this instance, even if Arnoux’s explanation
is suitable for cases of immediate death.</p>

<p>A soldier entered Val-de-Grâce February 27, 1915, in a
state of confusion following mine explosion the night before.
He was delirious, thought himself on leave, and had spells
of excitement. Lumbar puncture, February 29, showed a
slightly darkened fluid, with approximately normal amount of
albumin, one or two lymphocytes and rare red blood cells.</p>

<p>A brief period of slight improvement followed, but the
restlessness and delirium increased once more, became particularly
severe March 3, and the patient died on the night of
the third, seven days after the explosion.</p>

<p>The autopsy showed slightly congested lungs; no other
lesion except a sharply defined hemorrhage in the cervical
spinal meninges and over the meninges of the temporal
and occipital lobes. Microscopic section of the brain failed
to show any hemorrhages within the brain substance.</p>

<p>Here is a case of death following explosion without external
wound. The meningeal hemorrhages are hardly enough to
explain the death. The explanation of the death must
probably be made after histological examination.</p>

</div>

<h4><b>Case 200.</b> (<span class="smcap">Claude</span> and <span class="smcap">Lhermitte</span>, October, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A man, 23, was struck in the left thorax and shoulder, in
both thighs and the neck, by fragments from a bursting
shell March 27, 1915. One fragment was imbedded near the
vertebral column.</p>

<p>Twenty days later there was an absolute, flaccid paraplegia,
yet the legs occasionally gave spontaneous, jerky
movements. Tactile anesthesia reached the fourth dorsal
root-level, except that the perineoscrotal region and the penis
were somewhat sensitive. There was anesthesia to pain and
heat, as well as in bones and joints, along with the tactile
anesthesia. There was a hyperesthetic region on the right
side, corresponding with the distribution of the fourth dorsal
root. All the cutaneous reflexes up to the abdominals were
gone; but defense reflexes could be brought out in foot and
leg by skin, bone or joint stimulation. The deep reflexes of
the legs were also lost, whereas those of the arms were increased.
Retention of urine without incontinence; no retention
of feces. Sacral, trochanteric and heel decubitus
had developed in the course of the three weeks following
injury. A lymphangitis ran all the way up the right thigh
from one of the sores, with a corresponding hyperpyrexia.</p>

<p>Surgical intervention was indicated from the evidence of
spinal compression at a definite level, but the lymphangitis
grew worse. Oniric delirium, and finally a stuporous state,
set in, with death May 6, forty days after the wound, a death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
due to septicemia, without special alteration in the paraplegia
itself or in the sensory and reflex situation.</p>

<p>At autopsy the spine and dura mater proved normal; but
microscopically serial sections through the fourth and fifth
dorsal segments showed softening of the right anterior horn
and posterior columns, with cavitation in the radicular zones,
and the white matter of the fifth dorsal segment was in a
state of acute degeneration. There were also ependymal
changes, namely, at the fifth dorsal level a dilatation with
deposit of albumin; in the lumbar region, breakage of the
ependymal wall, with cellular gliosis. The dilated ependyma
was surrounded by an area of fibrillary gliosis which had proliferated
in the form of a septum in the interior of the canal.
(According to Claude and Lhermitte, these data concerning
hydromyelia, which they regard as secondary to trauma, are
an argument in favor of the traumatic origin of certain
syringomyelias. They regard the breakage of the ependymal
wall as due to hypertension of the spinal fluid due to
mechanical lesions.) Their interpretation of such acute degeneration
as was found in the fifth segment is that this
degeneration, as well as that of the posterior roots, is due to
the direct impact of the cerebrospinal fluid upon the cord
structure. As for the softenings with cavitation, they regard
them as surely due to spinal concussion and as very
possibly due to an ischemic necrosis, suggesting that older
work by Duret and Michel on concussion of the brain
indicates the possibility of a temporary ischemia of the spinal
cord from the violent impact of the spinal fluid upon the
cord due to shock of the spinal column. The transient
hypertension of the spinal fluid might well induce, they
believe, a vascular spasm with anemia, to which the gray
matter is well known to be especially sensitive. In the
present case, a period of somewhat less than six weeks had
sufficed to produce secondary degenerations above and below
the fifth dorsal segment, of a quite classical sort.</p>

<p>Accordingly, we here deal with a severe form of spinal concussion
due to a shellburst, in which intraspinal lesions were

<p>Shell explosion (1 meter distant) kills a soldier by
bursting both lungs within the intact thoracic cage.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 201.</b> (<span class="smcap">Sencert</span>, January, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A man of the 26th Regiment of Infantry was brought
October 26, 1914, to Ambulance No. 6 of the Twentieth Army
Corps at the Chateau d’Henu. Weakly and jerkily the man
was able to tell how, as he was going forward, a large calibre
shell fell less than a meter in front of him and exploded. He
fell back and lost consciousness, was picked up in the evening
and carried to the relief post and then to the ambulance, where
he arrived ten hours after the fall. There were signs of a considerable
shakeup, with pale and anxious face, nose pinched,
hollow eyes, rapid superficial respiration, small pulse, 120, and
a feeble voice. There were small skin wounds of the right
arm, a finger, and ear, but there was otherwise no wound.
The thorax and abdomen were somewhat painful all over, but
there was no especial point of pain. The chest showed a
slight dulness at the bases. Examination of the abdomen
produced defensive movements and the man vomited blood
during examination. He was put on his back, kept warm,
given artificial serum, hypodermic injections of camphorated
oil and caffeine, and carefully watched. In the night he
had another bloody vomiting, his pulse became smaller and
smaller, dyspnea became more and more intense, and he died
late in the night.</p>

<p>The autopsy showed that the abdomen was free of lesions
and that all the organs were of a normal appearance and color.
There was no sign of perforation or of peritonitis. The
stomach itself was filled with blood and there was a generalized
ecchymotic appearance of the mucosa, with small, submucous
hematomata and a number of tears in the pyloric portion.</p>

<p>The pleurae were found filled with blood, almost a quart
in each cavity. The right lung showed a large tear at the
level of the middle lobe, 15 cm. long. An orange-size, black
bit of lung protruded through the tear. There was no sign of
rib fracture opposite this tear, and no subpleural, intercostal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
or subcutaneous contusion. The thorax wall was perfectly
normal.</p>

<p>The left lung showed, in the middle portion of the upper
lobe, a somewhat analogous pleural tear, almost as big as that
on the right, with another large hernia of black lung. Bits
of the herniated lung sank in water. The thorax wall was
intact. The pericardium was free from blood. There was
nothing else abnormal about the body.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> effects of an explosion upon structures with intervening
objects left intact, Fauntleroy notes that a shell bursting
three yards from an aneroid barometer may force its levers
into an abnormal position. A further fact will indicate how
permanent is the physical state into which the levers are
forced; for when the barometer with its levers placed right
was placed under a bell-jar and the pressure therein was
reduced to 410 mm., the levers resumed the position into
which the explosion of the big shell had thrown them.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> windage and internal effects in the human body, Ravaut
recalls the fact that the internal and intraneural hemorrhages
of Caisson disease (“bends”) are well known. The
external hemorrhages of aeronauts and mountain climbers
belong in the same physical class. Dynamite exploded in a
pond kills fish. Dynamite may break pillars inside a building
without damaging its front. Cases like Chavigny’s (<a href="#case198">198</a>),
Roussy and Boisseau’s (<a href="#case199">199</a>), Claude and Lhermitte’s (<a href="#case200">200</a>),
as well as Ravaut’s own case (<a href="#case202">202</a>) are in point.</p>

<p>Shell explosion near by: Paraplegia, interpreted as
due to windage. Two foci of HEMORRHAGE
(SPINAL CANAL, BLADDER) clinically proved to
exist in a case without external sign of injury.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 202.</b> (<span class="smcap">Ravaut</span>, February, 1915.)</h4>

<p>An infantry sergeant was brought to the ambulance, one
day in November, 1914, with a paralysis which had set in
immediately upon the explosion of a large shell a short distance
away. Both legs were paralyzed and there was anesthesia
to the navel. He could not urinate. It was early
in the war, and Ravaut thought he would find an injury to
the vertebral column, but on undressing the soldier there
was no wound. The skin was intact, and there was not even
an ecchymosis. The patient was suffering not at all, but
said that after the shell exploded he felt a forcible shock,
was stunned for a moment, and when he wanted to rise, found
that his legs were inert. His state did not change during the
day and he did not urinate. Catheterization showed a
urine full of blood. This indicated a lumbar puncture, and a
bloody fluid emerged under great pressure. Thus two foci
of hemorrhage were proven to exist in this patient despite
the fact that there was no external lesion.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> windage effects, see suggestions of Ravaut under <a href="#case201">Case
201</a>. Ravaut also suggests that certain cases of emotional
jaundice may be similarly explained on the basis of internal
lesion due to windage. Sundry cases of gastro-intestinal
disorder and of hemoptysis fall into the same class; possibly
the cases of death in a fixed posture belong there, too.
Ravaut thinks, despite the look of hysteria about the shell-shock
cases of paraplegia, deafness, mutism, and the like,
that the cases are actually ones in which there has been at
the beginning a slight or severe hemorrhage, clearing up in
a few days. He states that there is a pretty definite parallelism
between the course of the clinical symptoms and the
chemical characteristics of the spinal fluid.</p>

<h4><b>Case 203.</b> (<span class="smcap">Froment</span>, July, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A Sergeant lying down in a small dugout space, 2 × 1 m.
high, had a 77 shell burst behind his head and between his
head and the back of the dugout. The patient was not
moved by the explosion, but was buried in a small amount
of earth and stones to a depth of about 20 cm. He was not
wounded and showed no ecchymoses either then or later.
Aided by stretcher bearers, he was able to walk to the relief
post about 400 meters from the trench. He did not lose
consciousness, and got to the relief post about a quarter
of an hour after the shell burst. Thereafter, however, he
was unable to move his legs. The accident happened
February 6 at 4 o’clock. He was examined 24 hours after
the trauma. The accompanying diagrams show the variations
in sensory disorder at intervals during six months.</p>

<p>A lumbar puncture, February 8, 1915, showed hypertensive
clear fluid without macroscopic clot on centrifuging, but
showing a number of red blood cells and lymphocytes&mdash;3
or 4 to the microscopic field. There was a slight hyperalbuminosis.
The development of the muscular atrophy and
hypo-excitability of the left lower extremity, the exaggeration
of the left knee-jerk, together with the spinal fluid
appearances, seemed to prove the organic nature of the paraplegia.
There was an intense rhachialgia, with radiation
along the sciatic nerve. This outlasted all other symptoms.
Thermo-analgesia was the most prominent sensory disorder.
There were no sphincter disorders.</p>

<p>During the first days, the anesthesia was of a pure segmentary
type, with nothing about it to suggest that it was
later to be supplanted by a radicular type of disorder. Hematomyelia
was, years ago, thought&mdash;according to Froment&mdash;to
tend to yield sensory disorders of a segmentary nature.
At the outset this anesthesia was total, though there was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
vague, poorly localized feeling on intense painful excitations,&mdash;as
with energetic pricking or burning. Thus the protopathic
sensibility of Head had remained, whereas the epicritic
sensibility had disappeared.</p>

<p>Detailed examination of this case showed extreme errors
in the position sense. For example, pricking the foot might
be localized as pinching above the knee. The cremaster
reflex was extremely marked and would appear upon even
slight excitation of any part of the lower extremity, even at
times when the patient declared he felt nothing. These
phenomena at the beginning early gave place to a syringomyelic
type of anesthesia.</p>

<p>At the time of report, July 29, 1915, Froment regarded this
case as analogous to hematomyelias of divers, although there
is not such a degree of decompression; the suddenness of
the decompression is more marked in these Shell-shock cases
than in divers.</p>

Hemiplegia with reflex signs thought to be
organic; hypertensive spinal fluid; LYMPHOCYTOSIS.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 204.</b> (<span class="smcap">Guillain</span>, August, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A corporal in the engineers was going the night of June
7th to a creneau of mitrailleuses, when he was bowled over
by a bursting shell. He lost consciousness and was carried
to the cantonment by his comrades. Next morning he complained
of headache and pain in the back; had a convulsion;
and proved on examination to have a left-sided hemiplegia.
He was given the diagnosis of hysterical hemiplegia.</p>

<p>He was sent to the 6th Army neurological center, and there
showed a complete left-sided hemiplegia with tendency to
contracture. The left knee-jerk and arm reflexes were
exaggerated, and there was ankle and patella clonus with
Babinski sign. There was a dysesthesia on the left side,
with wrong interpretation and poor localization of painful
stimuli, and non-recognition of cold and heat sensations.
Muscle sense and stereognosis were impaired. There was a
slight dysarthria. Lumbar puncture yielded a clear hypertensive
fluid with a slight lymphocytosis.</p>

<p>The situation remained without change for a month, when
the patient was evacuated to the rear. Thus, a shell-burst
can produce destructive nerve lesions without evidence of
external injury.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> hypertensive spinal fluid, Sollier and Chartier cite Dejerine
as having brought the proof of hypertension in the
cerebrospinal fluid in Shell-shock cases. They also believe
that the Shell-shock hysteria is built up on a physical basis,
more or less after the model of Charcot’s hysterotraumatism.
Shock, windage, and gas may bring about the same
kind of result. They rely especially on the cases of Sencert
(<a href="#case201">201</a>) and Ravaut (<a href="#case202">202</a>) for their argument (1915).
They recall the fact that Charcot found a hysteria due to
lightning stroke and to high tension electric accidents. They
quote Lermoyez as attributing like results in ear cases to
labyrinthine shock, tympanic rupture, and ear hemorrhages.</p>

<h4><b>Case 205.</b> (<span class="smcap">Souques</span>, <span class="smcap">Megevand</span> and <span class="smcap">Donnet</span>, October,
1915.)</h4>

<p>A French sergeant, a machine gunner, was the victim of
shell-burst September 25, 1915, was evacuated with a diagnosis
of commotio cerebri, and, when examined at Paul-Brousse
October 5, showed a right-sided hemiparesis, clouding
of consciousness and somnolence, the hemiparesis involving
the face, with deviation of tongue to right, Babinski reflex
right, cremasteric and abdominal reflexes abolished on right.
Normal respiration and pulse.</p>

<p>Lumbar puncture October 7, that is, thirteen days after
the injury, yielded a clear fluid with an excess of albumin,
144 small lymphocytes (some degenerate) and a single endothelial
cell.</p>

<p>October 12, the knee-jerk was a little less lively on the
right side. The plantar reflex varied between extension and
flexion on the right side. The cremasteric reflex had been
weakly regained on the right side.</p>

<p>The patient was now less stupid and could tell how he
jumped when the shell burst, and how he had been in the air
ten minutes (!) and fell, getting up at once, with nothing
wrong except nosebleed. After a half-hour he felt weaker
and was ordered to leave the post, whereupon, on the road,
his weakness increased and he tended to fall to the right, but
reached the ambulance on foot.</p>

<p>October 23, there was no longer any evidence of hemiparesis,
the Babinski reflex had entirely disappeared; there was no
complaint except of dizziness and headaches. He got back
his autocritique on the matter of remaining in the air ten
minutes, but there was still an amnesia for the ten day period
between the shock and his arrival at Paul-Brousse. He
forgot that he had had a lumbar puncture October 7.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>Another puncture, October 25, yielded some 14 or 15
lymphocytes to the cmm. There was still an excess of albumin.
The lymphocytes decreased further according to a
puncture November 2. Had this patient been examined
some weeks after the shock there would have been no signs
of an organic paresis, no special modification of the spinal
fluid, and no reason for regarding the man as other than an
hysteric. Early spinal puncture is, accordingly, important.</p>

<p>Of course, the question whether the lymphocytes and hyperalbuminosis
of the fluid might not be syphilitic must be raised.
At the Hospital Medical Society meeting, October 29, 1915,
Souques states that Ravaut and Guillain believe that simple
shell-shock often produces “syphilitic” chemical, physical
or cytological changes in the spinal fluid. Roussy is cited
as thinking such changes rare.</p>

as if stunned. He did not talk or understand what was
said, but was able to write a few words. The knee-jerks were
a little exaggerated. There was a slight spasticity of the
limbs, which was exaggerated on emotion into a sort of
spasmodic crisis.</p>

<p>Lumbar puncture gave a reddish fluid under strong tension.
After lumbar puncture the man came out of coma and
the next day, after another puncture (fluid slightly yellowish),
there was further improvement and the patient spoke.
The third puncture, March 20, yielded yellow fluid. The
spastic phenomena still persisted, however. The patient

</div>

<h4><b>Case 207.</b> (<span class="smcap">Leriche</span>, September, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A patient entered an evacuation hospital June 27, having
come from an ambulance with a ticket reading, “Melancholic
depression, with stupor&mdash;attempt at suicide (threw himself
into a pond)&mdash;sprained ankle&mdash;to be evacuated, lying
down, on a milk diet.” The patient was depressed, indifferent
to surroundings, irresponsive, and did not even look at an
interlocutor. There was no other somatic sign except a
pulse of 62. He did not eat, and remained lying down, without
movement. Lumbar puncture in a sitting posture yielded
a clear liquid under pressure of 34. June 30, another lumbar
puncture yielded clear fluid of a dichroic appearance when
looked at from above. 25 c.c. were removed. July 1, there
had been a good deal of improvement. The patient said he
was better and began to take a little milk. July 2, there was
still some improvement. Pulse 60. He said that his condition
had lasted a month and that it followed a violent and
prolonged bombardment for ten days in his sector. July
3, he was much better, began to look about, talk, and eat a
little. July 4, lumbar puncture yielded a clear fluid with a
pressure of 30, reduced to 22 after withdrawal of 20 c.c.</p>

<p>According to Leriche, explosion of large calibre shells or
of a mine can produce cerebral or spinal symptoms, some of
which are removed by lumbar puncture. The fluid is red
shortly after the explosion and under hypertension for some
days. Such hypertension may be found even in shell cases
that have no other sign of cerebral condition. This particular
melancholy patient had a relapse and another depression
with fugue.</p>

<p>Example of HEMATOMYELIA, indirect result of
bullet wound. Partial recovery.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 208.</b> (<span class="smcap">Mendelssohn</span>, January, 1916.)</h4>

<p>An infantry subaltern, 23 years old, was injured September
24, 1914, by a rifle bullet, which entered above the left
clavicle and emerged between the right scapula and the vertebral
column. The patient leaped into the air when he was
struck, but fell at once and found that his legs were paralyzed.
A feeling of cold crept up from the feet to the region of the
umbilicus. Consciousness was preserved. There was hemoptysis
because of the bullet’s passing through the left lung.
The wounds all healed quickly. There was retention, followed
by incontinence, of urine and feces; and the situation
was complicated by eschars in the gluteal and trochanteric
region.</p>

<p>For three months there was no change in the paraplegia,
except that at the beginning of the third month the patient
could move his fingers a little and raise his knees slightly. He
was transferred back through three hospital units, with a
diagnosis of spinal cord lesion or fracture due to a vertebral
column lesion at the second and third dorsal vertebrae.</p>

<p>Seven months after injury, he reached a Russian hospital
for a laminectomy, incapable of standing or walking without
support, although able to sit and rise with extreme difficulty.
He could now very slightly flex and extend the knees, and
very slightly flex and rotate the ankle, and weakly move the
toes. Passive movements could be carried out without much
difficulty, though there was a slight joint and muscle stiffness.
Both quadriceps muscles were markedly atrophied. There
was slight amyotrophy of the lower legs. Tendon reflexes
were exaggerated, and there was a marked ankle clonus, a
Babinski reflex, and an abolition of the abdominal and cremasteric
reflexes.</p>

<p>There was a sensory disorder of an incomplete syringomyelic
pattern, with diminished sensibility to heat and
complete abolition of pain sensibility. Touch and electric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
sensations were somewhat delayed. There was a diminution
in the faradic and galvanic excitability of the legs and feet;
vasomotor disturbance (slight hyperidrosis) of the paralyzed
limbs. Two of the eschars had not yet cicatrized. The
sphincteric disturbances had diminished. For the rest the
patient was normal. The second and third vertebrae showed
deformity and were painful to pressure and percussion of
spinous processes.</p>

<p>The patient was treated by galvanization of the spine, with
a current descending at first and then ascending, and by
faradization of the paralyzed muscles. There was progressive
improvement, irregular but constant. At the time of
report, July 1, 1915, he was perfectly well, able to take long
walks, and without sphincter or sensory disturbance. The
tendon reflexes were still exaggerated, and there was still a
slight ankle clonus and Babinski. The abdominal and cremasteric
reflexes were still abolished. The last of the seven
eschars had not yet healed over.</p>

<p>For the organic nature of this lesion, the numerous early
eschars, the persistent sphincter disturbances, the limited
paresis of the legs, the reflex disorders, and the dissociation
of sensations seem abundant evidence. It is probable that
there was no fracture of the vertebrae (X-ray confirmation),
and it is probable that there was a meningeal hemorrhage,
together with some hemorrhagic foci in the spinal cord substance,
especially in the gray matter. A good deal remains
doubtful: Mendelssohn remarks that the sphincter disturbances
ought to be related to disorder of the fourth and fifth
sacral segments, and the knee-jerk and Achilles jerk absence
with disorder of the lower lumbar, and sacral region; the
abdominal reflex disorder with the low thoracic lesion; the
distribution of the anesthesia ought to indicate a lesion in
the lower part of the spinal cord. Was not the hemorrhage
therefore lower down than the spot where the vertebrae were
displaced? It is surely of prognostic note that the eschars
did not necessarily foretell a fatal outcome; in fact, the
patient had become functionally well before the seventh
eschar was healed over.</p>

<h4><b>Case 209.</b> (<span class="smcap">Babinski</span>, June, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A veterinary student, six months captive in Germany,
wrote out for Babinski the following:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“September 1, 1914, I was about to operate a machine
gun when a shrapnel shell exploded very near me,&mdash;probably
about two or three metres overhead. I
base this estimate on comparisons made with shells I
saw exploded beside me before this one.</p>

<p>“Just after the explosion, which deafened me and at
the same time took my breath away a little, from the
powder, I felt a rather severe pain in the kidney region,&mdash;a
pain which then persisted without interruption.
I moved my left arm, to find the effect produced by a
bullet which I heard whistle by my ear and which
struck the upper part of the left shoulder without
entering. At the same time, I tried to turn to see
what had become of my legs, and had a feeling that
they had vanished. Almost immediately I felt little
prickings, not very painful, in the lumbar region and
in the upper part of the thighs. Just then, seeing my
comrades going away I tried to imitate them, but could
not. All these feelings passed very rapidly.</p>

<p>“A comrade then came near to tell me to go back.
I told him that I could not move and that I must have
been wounded in the lumbar region. He looked at my
kit and my coat and said there was no trace of shot or
tear. Not wanting to leave me, he lifted me by the
armpits and knees. I could not help him get me up,
and my legs hung flexed and inert. After a few steps
he had to put me down, and tried to stand me up. I
immediately crumpled. I had no sensation of my feet
touching the ground. I sent my comrade back, asking
him to tell my brother, who was in my squad. I did
not lose consciousness or any feeling of my situation, or
of the danger being run by my comrade.”</p>

</div>

<p>The man remained four days on the battle field without
food. He was on the edge of a stream. He did not defecate,
nor for two days did he urinate. Eventually the bladder and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
rectal functions were re-established, though they remained
irregular. Catheterization was never resorted to. The lumbar
pains were diffuse, fixing themselves a few days after the
accident in the region below the umbilicus. There were
pains at the waist predominating on the left side. The
paralysis of the lower extremities grew rapidly better.
Movements in the right leg reappeared, and 27 days after the
accident the man was able to stand and walk around his bed.
Still further movement followed (left leg weaker).</p>

<p>At the time of the report, May 28, 1915, the patient could
walk without a cane, but he could get about only slowly.
The left toes would rub against the ground, and he could not
support himself for any length of time on his legs. The
knee-jerks were exaggerated, especially the left. The
Achilles jerks were increased. There was a Babinski reflex
on the left side and an abduction of the fifth toe on plantar
stimulation. The same reflexes were found on the right side,
but less marked. Abdominal reflexes absent, except the
right superior reflex, which was distinctly present. Cremasteric
reflexes absent. Anal reflexes preserved. The defense
reflexes were exaggerated, but more markedly on the left
side. The zone from which the defense reflexes could be
elicited on the left side included the whole lower extremity
and rose as far as 2 or 3 cm. above the nipple. Stimulation
of the lateral parts of the left lower extremity would even
produce defense reflex movements on both sides of the body.
On the right side, however, the defense reflex movements
could only be tried out by scratching the anterior surface of
the ankle, which was then followed by a flexion of the foot.</p>

<p>Sensibility to touch and deep sensibility were preserved;
but sensibility to temperature and pain, normal on the left,&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
paralyzed&mdash;side, was weak in the right leg. There
was a marked sudation on the left side, limited by the white
line, the inguinal fold, the iliac spines, and a horizontal line
passing through the umbilicus.</p>

<p>Here, then, paralysis followed a shell explosion while the
subject was lying down. No contusion therefore was possible.
According to Babinski, we are dealing probably with
a hematomyelia, the result of shell explosion.</p>

<p>Struck by missile in back; unconsciousness; no

</div>

<h4><b>Case 210.</b> (<span class="smcap">Elliot</span>, December, 1914.)</h4>

<p>November 1, 1914, a sergeant in the 20th Hussars, with
other dismounted cavalrymen, was chasing Germans with
a bayonet, over turnip fields pitted by shells. Several hours
later, he found himself in a house in a nearby village, to
which he had been carried unconscious. Probably he had
been struck by some missile in the back, as the bottom of his
haversack had been torn off. His face was blackened with
smoke, and his clothes were muddy. He had no wound.
His left arm was weak and his legs powerless and numb.
The passing of water was painful, but there was no blood in
the water and no hemoptysis.</p>

<p>Five days later, he was examined at a base hospital and
found to be paralyzed and numb in the legs. The knee-jerk
and ankle-jerk were retained upon the right side only. Pain
occurred on passive movements of the legs, which were
flaccid; there was a hyperalgesia about Poupart’s ligament,
more marked on the left side. Lower abdominal reflexes
were weak on the left side; pain in lower abdomen with
bladder full and at outset of micturition. Pain and paresis
also affected the left arm, but there was no numbness. Pain
on pressure over lumbar and cervical vertebral spines.
There was no evidence of bruising.</p>

<p>The physicians were inclined to regard the phenomena as
hysterical. Three days later, the arm movements became
much freer, and after another three days, the arm movements
were fairly powerful, and the legs much stronger, although
the patient could not yet stand or walk. He still
had pain if his bladder was full.</p>

<p>As against the diagnosis of hysteria, three herpetic clusters
appeared on the skin of the left thigh, from three to six inches
above the knee. Elliot regards it as certain that the posterior
root ganglia were injured. He regards the case as
one of injury to the spinal nerve roots. The hyperalgesia
about the body of course suggested damage to the spinal
cord. According to Elliot, therefore, this case is one of
organic disease; whether of the roots or of the cord was uncertain.
At any rate the cases of this type, though not
functional, recovered.</p>

<h4><b>Case 211.</b> (<span class="smcap">Lebar</span>, June, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A soldier, 23, in the Argonne was blown up by a mine in
a trench, fell, and was covered by a mass of earth, from
which he extricated himself. He immediately became deaf
from what was medically determined to be a double hemorrhagic
labyrinthitis. There were also superficial powder
burns of the face, as well as several bruises on the head,
especially on the left side.</p>

<p>The next day, at the English hospital at Arc-en-Barrois,
the patient noticed tufts of white hair on the left side of the
head. There were four islets of gray hair in the left fronto-parieto-occipital
region, separated from one another by normal
hairs. The gray hairs were gray completely from the
roots to the ends of the hair. The longest hairs were as
white as the shortest. There was not a brown hair amongst
them. The gray hairs were solidly implanted, and could
be pulled out only by strong traction. There was a discoloration
also of the bulbar swelling of the hair. The rest
of the head hair was dark brown. His hair was described
in the military description: “deep chestnut brown.” There
was no other symptom aside from an incessant twitching of
the left eyelids. The place of whitening was apparently
determined by the region of the scalp injured. Not only
were the bruises on the left side of the head and face, but
the labyrinthine lesions were more marked on this side and
the twitching of the eye-lids was confined to the left side.</p>

<p>A Russian private, 24, was wounded twice: once in the
head by a bullet, and at another time by a bit of shrapnel
that imbedded itself in the skull. The hair over the injured
spot became gray.</p>

<p>Later, September 16, 1915, the soldier was subjected to
shell-shock, and at the same time wounded by shrapnel fragment
in the right leg (operated next day).</p>

<p>Upon examination at Petrograd, the hearing was found
diminished and the eardrum was pulled in. At first the
patient could not speak or open his eyes, and made incessant
lateral movements of the head, jerking backwards and to the
right. The right half of the face gave convulsive movements,
which began at the lip and spread upwards. During
sleep, there was an entire cessation of these head shakings
and jerks. In the lying posture, the head shook at a rate of
100 to 120 per minute. The jerking movements became
more marked when the patient sat up or walked. He carried
his head bent toward the right shoulder. When he sat down,
the side-shaking movements disappeared, only to reappear
when he lay down. The swallowing reflexes were absent.
The sensitiveness to touch, pain, and temperature was lost
in the upper part of the trunk including the neck, to the level
of the tenth dorsal vertebra. There was anesthesia of the
arms as far as the elbow on the right, and as far as the
shoulder on the left. The mucosae of the mouth were anesthetic.
Dermatographia was strongly marked.</p>

<p>A soldier was blown up by a shell and then buried at Vaux,
March 29, 1916, and entered the Salpêtrière, July, 1916, with
a right-sided hemiplegia and contracture without evidence of
wound. He remembered nothing for the first fortnight after
the trauma. When he came to himself, he was paralyzed
and was unable to say more than a few words, but at the
end of a month his aphasia ceased and he began to walk.</p>

<p>The hemiplegia was spastic. There was pronounced
contracture. The arm was extended, hand open, fingers
stretched. Finger movements were diminished, as well as
extension of the wrist, but the arm was otherwise normal.
The leg was not so stiff. The great toe was in a state of continuous
extension. The toes could not be moved, and the
foot scarcely; but the leg could be strongly flexed and extended
on the thigh. The tendon reflexes of the right side
were more lively than on the left. Cloniform movements
followed tapping the patellar tendon on the right side, and a
patellar clonus and ankle clonus could also be demonstrated.
Plantar reflex, flexor on the right. Distinct adduction of the
foot. Slight disturbance of tactile sensibility in the paralyzed
limbs; marked disorder of position sense and gross
disturbance of stereognostic sense. Moderate dysarthria.</p>

<p>Ten months after the traumatism, the hemiplegia and
spastic walk remained. The upper limb was now carried in
extension back of the body, with hand supinated, fingers
sometimes in extension, sometimes in flexion, index finger
separately from the others. Finger movements difficult and
shoulder movements limited. The leg, however, was almost
normal except that the toes could not be moved. The tendon
reflexes were more lively and cloniform on the right, but
there was no longer patellar or ankle clonus. Stereognosis
slow, but finger movements were naturally difficult. W. R.

<h4><b>Case 214.</b> (<span class="smcap">Claude</span> and <span class="smcap">Lhermitte</span>, October, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A man, 38, was blown up in a trench without sustaining
skin or skeletal lesions, April 5, 1915. He lost consciousness
for a half hour and, coming to, found a crural paraplegia
and urinary retention. Examined July 24, in addition to the
paraplegia were found tactile and algesic hypesthesia of the
legs with preservation of deep sensibility. Pains were felt
in the legs, especially in the hips. The knee-jerks were
abolished; the Achilles jerks were preserved, as well as the
flexor plantar reflexes and somewhat weakened cremasteric
and abdominal reflexes. Micturition was difficult. Constipation.
Slight paresis of left arm. Lumbar puncture,
July 28, yielded a clear fluid of normal tension without
chemical or cytological changes.</p>

<p>The sphincter disorders gradually disappeared. The knee-jerks
reappeared in a weakened form August 31. The legs
could, at the time of report, be moved somewhat, though not
above the level of the bed.</p>

<p>We here deal, presumably, with a mild form of concussion
of the spinal cord, in which, however, some of the transient
symptoms are very possibly merely functional in origin.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> complicated pictures of organic and functional nature,
some experimental work has been carried out. Mairet and
Durante set off explosives, such as melinite, at a distance of
1 to 1.5 metres, near rabbits. Some died at intervals from
an hour to thirteen days; others lived. Pulmonary apoplexy
was found in the cases dying early. Spinal cord and
root hemorrhages, hemorrhages in the cortical and bulbar
gray, perivascular and ependymal hemorrhages were found,
always small and without diffusion, suggesting rupture by
rapid decompression following the first wave of aerial compression.
The functional effects are thought to be brought
about through the anemia of the areas supplied by the ruptured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
vessels. Russca of Berne got similar results and notes
direct and contrecoup brain lesions, tympanic perforations,
intra- and extra-ocular hemorrhages, thoracic, cardiac, and
splenic hemorrhages, ruptures of kidney, stomach, intestine,
and diaphragm. As in the work of Mairet and Durante,
the lung proved the most sensitive organ. (Compare also
the human case of Sencert [<a href="#case201">Case 201</a>].) Some experiments
with fishes yielded lesions of the swimming bladder. Persalite
and other explosives were used.</p>

<p>GASSING: Organic-looking picture.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 215.</b> (<span class="smcap">Neiding</span>, May, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A German soldier, 21, was a serious case of gassing. He
was unconscious two days (venesection twice). When he
came to, he could not walk and felt as if he were drunk.
October 22, 1916, he was incoördinate in walking and tended
to fall forward when standing with eyes closed. The ataxia
of the legs was demonstrable in the position of dorsal decubitus,
and there was also a slight ataxia of the arms. The
pupils were dilated and reacted poorly to light.</p>

<p>December 12, all symptoms had disappeared. The clinical
picture in this case was somewhat like that of a multiple
sclerosis. According to Neiding, the disorder is not a functional
one but an organic cerebellar disorder.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> the neurology of gas poisoning, Neiding regards the
condition as a new nosological unit. We do not know
what the ultimate results of apparently cured cases will be.
Court questions of importance will doubtless arise with reference
to their compensation. Ninety-six of Neiding’s 274
cases failed to show any nerve symptoms whatever; forty-six
cases showed one symptom only, such as headache, dizziness,
abnormality of reflexes, or abnormality in sensation.
One hundred and thirty-two cases presented a fairly full
picture. The picture of a complete traumatic neurosis not
infrequently appears, aided perhaps by the psychic features
of the gas attacks; and possibly some cases are entirely
psychogenic from the beginning. Such symptoms, for example,
as dermatographia, rapid and irregular heart, hyperidrosis,
blepharospasm, mental perturbation, hypochondria,
etc., do not necessarily point to any directly toxic effect
of the gases. Thirty-seven of Neiding’s cases showed
pupillary changes, hyperreflexia, and analgesia. Thirty-one
showed analgesia and absence of laryngeal and corneal reflexes.
Twenty-six showed pupillary changes and hyperreflexia,
four of these latter showing also an absence of laryngeal
and corneal reflexes. One case yielded hyperalgesia alone;
ten yielded headache, dizziness, and analgesia.</p>

<p>GASSING: Mutism, tremors, depression, battle
dreams.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 216.</b> (<span class="smcap">Wiltshire</span>, June, 1916.)</h4>

<p>An infantryman, aged 27, had been at the front for three
months. He was wounded a month before coming to hospital;
but when the wound healed he went back to the front,
quite mute but intelligent and able to write the following:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We were on our way to the trenches, and as we
were going through the railway cutting they started to
shell us, with gas shells mostly, and we had not been
there more than quarter of an hour when I was compelled
to lie down from temporary blindness and weakness
through getting a dose of gas through my mouth
and eyes. I was lying down for about ten minutes
when a shell came somewhere near, and was struck by
something in the face and on my left knee and I remembered
no more until I found myself in hospital.
I was all of a shake and while lying down would frequently
jump up and wonder where I was.”</p>

</div>

<p>The patient had been mute thereafter, depressed, and
given to dreams about fighting and shells. There was a fine
tremor controllable by the will; the knee-jerks were increased.
On lateral deviation, there was difficulty in fixing
the eyes. There was a slight deafness due to an old discharging
left ear. According to Wiltshire, Shell-shock is only
exceptionally caused by chemical poisoning from gas.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> poisoning by certain German asphyxiating gases,
Sereysky reports in 1917 that these gases contained, among
other poisons, a nerve poison. He found that poor heredity
was a favorable soil for the action of this nerve poison. The
clinical pictures in the gassed soldiers rather suggested cerebral
arteriosclerosis. He remarks that the logical distance
between the “exogenous” and “endogenous” is greatly
reduced in these gassed cases, as the syndrome of “exogenous”
gassing closely approximates that of various “endogenous”
disorders.</p>

<p>Hysterical speech disorder related to mechanical
disorder of auditory apparatus.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 217.</b> (<span class="smcap">Binswanger</span>, July, 1915.)</h4>

<p>Whenever a German officer’s servant, 23 years, was addressed
on the ward in the Jena Nerve Hospital, his hands
would tremble and the muscles of his face would fall into
grimacing associated movements. He had a peculiar infantile
type of speech, talking with a fixed glance and an anxious
mien. He would carefully utter, as a rule, separate words,
chiefly only nouns or infinitives. He would gesticulate with
both hands to make what he said understood. Thus (freely
translating the German) runs his description of a battle:</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;because&mdash;I&mdash;we had&mdash;no artillery and so
many losses&mdash;then got in position again, then we&mdash;laid
down a long time&mdash;perhaps until four o’clock in the afternoon&mdash;five&mdash;and&mdash;and
it happened that&mdash;lay in Rübenfeld&mdash;couldn’t
go back&mdash;then shell near me&mdash;fell in and I
right near, how&mdash;how far&mdash;I don’t know and&mdash;grown
better. Comrade said&mdash;10 meters&mdash;don’t know&mdash;un&mdash;unconscious.”</p>

<p>Long compound German words could not be repeated,
since after the first or second syllable there was a severe emotional
excitement; syllable articulation and phonation ceased.
Finally, however, the patient could be gotten to pronounce the
whole word. Reading aloud was very difficult: syllable sounding
and omission of difficult syllables; after a time, weeping.</p>

<p>The patient was a somewhat small, muscular, well-nourished
man, with a murmur at the apex, a somewhat rapid
pulse, increased reflexes, especially skin reflexes, painful
supra- and infra-orbital points, temples painful to percussion,
pressure over spine painful from second thoracic to third
lumbar vertebrae. There was an increased sensitiveness to
touch and pain over the whole body. There was a bilateral,
somewhat marked tremor, more marked on the left side than
on the right. Swaying in Romberg position was slight.
Tremor of tongue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>This patient was first brought to Jena November 23, 1914.
An illegitimate child, a moderately good scholar, he had
worked as a mason until he went into the army, in 1912. He
worked as a soldier chiefly in the officers’ casino because
he got pains in his legs and knees in long drills. At the
outset of the campaign, however, he withstood the heavy
marching, although with difficulty. He was in his first actual
skirmish September 20. A shell struck nearby and threw
him several meters; whereupon he became unconscious and
was carried away by the hospital corps. When he woke up
he could not speak or hear. Ten days later, however,
speech returned, and hearing returned in right ear; October,
deaf in the left ear, and he could not hear a watch tick
on the right side at a distance of 16 centimeters. He was
examined at the otological clinic in Jena October 12, where
the drum membranes were both found opaque, without
reflexes or normal contours; hysterical attack on the caloric
test. The next day, on the medical visit, there was a
screaming attack. His plight seemed not so much simulation
as one of traumatic hysteria.</p>

<p>Again, after his stay at the nerve hospital, another hysterical
outburst was produced by a hearing test with vestibular
apparatus, in the ear clinic, February 6, 1915. The
diagnosis was nervous deafness with involvement of left ear.</p>

<p>The insomnia was successfully treated by sodium bicarbonate.
There was a slight improvement in speech. In
March body weight had improved, but there was a marked
tremor of the right hand. In the next few months there was
a progressive improvement in general well-being, in speech
disorder, and in tremor. The auditory disorder remained
unchanged. The man now works in his father’s garden.</p>

<p>This case appears to show a combination of psychic and
mechanical injury. There are severe hysterical auditory
and speech disorders. Although the auditory disorder is
of mechanical origin, the speech disorder appears to be of
psychogenic nature. It is somewhat remarkable that the
ear tests almost every time produce hysterical attacks in the
form of convulsive crying. Rather unusual is the general
cutaneous hyperalgesia, more marked about the ears.</p>

<h4><b>Case 218.</b> (<span class="smcap">Pitres</span> and <span class="smcap">Marchand</span>, November, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A lieutenant underwent “shell-shock” either at night or in
the early morning, September, 1915, the shell bursting at a
distance. He neither saw nor heard the shell, lost consciousness
and was eight days semicomatose, failing to recognize
his wife.</p>

<p>On recovering his senses, he could not get about, as he
had lost his memory, having to write down his room number
and be warned of meal times. He was led about like a child.
He had a continuous headache on the right side and pains in
the occiput and along the spinal column, as well as in the
right leg as far as the heel. These leg pains were lightning
pains. Walking was difficult, staggering, leaning to left.
Weakness of right arm and leg; right-sided hemianalgesia.
Complete insomnia. During November there were frequent
urgent desires to urinate day or night. Evacuated to the
oto-rhino-laryngological center in Bordeaux, December 13, for
examination of ears. The right ear was found normal, but
there was a rupture of the left tympanum. There was at
this time a trismus. The jaws were opened with the dilator
and the man had a syncope during this operation. The
question of surgical intervention for a cerebral lesion was
raised, but he was first sent to the neurologists at Bordeaux.
There, December 31, he was found with a facies of anguish,
unstable gait, inclination to the left in walking; no Rombergism;
occasional dizzy spells. In walking, the right foot
was pointed outward and on request to direct it forward he
complained of pain in the loins, reaching as far as the scapula.
Walking with eyes closed, he leaned to the left and lost balance.
With eyes open, no disorder of balance. With eyes
closed, the body leaned backward. If requested to go back,
he failed to flex his legs to keep balance. If he was asked to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
put a foot upon the chair in front of him, he immediately
fell backwards. He could not support his body on the right
leg more than a few moments. He had difficulty in raising
both legs from the bed at one time and he could lift the right
leg not so high as the left. Movements of the legs were
performed hesitatingly and slowly and with greater difficulty
with eyes closed.</p>

<p>He could not thread a needle and could hardly dress himself.
Eyes closed, he could with difficulty perform the finger
to nose test; eyes open, with much less difficulty. Adiadochokinesis;
muscular strength less in right than left; plantar
reflexes absent; knee-jerks lively; hemianalgesia, right side.
Loss of deep and bony sensibility on right side and diminution
of testicular sensibility. Retraction of visual field, right;
diminution of smell and loss of hearing, right; position sense
absent on this side; stereognostic sense preserved. Mentally,
memory was poor; he was unable to read or do mental
work. He slept little and had bad battle dreams. He was
very impressionable and emotional and constantly complained
of occipital pain. He had lost 8 kilos weight.</p>

<p>He grew gradually better. In May he could go out alone.
The muscular strength increased. The adiadochokinesis and
synergic disturbances lessened; the hemianesthesia persisted.
In June there was greater improvement; in fact, there was
no sign of disorder left except irregular sleep.</p>

Upon recovery of consciousness, the patient was
dumb, unable to work, very nervous, paralyzed as to left

he threw his legs about in an unusual fashion. Several
months later the patient was much improved.</p>

<p>Shortly, there was a relapse. Transferred to a hospital

of starting in terror at the slightest noise.</p>

<p>Hypnotic treatment was followed by almost complete
disappearance of the tremor. The patient began to sleep

man was able to remember how at the moment he was injured
he felt a sort of strain in his brain, felt his head with his hand,
found he was bleeding, took out a bandage from his kit, removed
it from its cover and without unfolding it put it on his
head. At this moment he fell unconscious and there was then
complete loss of memory for three weeks. This patient,
who was intellectually keen, distinguished exactly between
what he could himself remember and what he was told by his
comrades. One of these had told him that he had cried out
indistinctly that in a matter of fifteen days he would be well.
He estimated the interval between his wound and the loss of
consciousness as about five minutes.</p>

<p>After three weeks, the tailor came to and remembers that
the first word he heard was Munich. Astonished to be in
Bavaria he asked for paper and pen to write to his people,
but found he could not write, though still able to dictate a
little to his comrades. Besides agraphia there was hemiplegia
on the right side, marked exhaustion, rapid fatiguability of
vision, power of concentration but slightly diminished, and
apathy for his surroundings; emotions normal.</p>

<p>Three weeks later the power to write returned; after six
weeks, sleep; memory was restored in from six to eight weeks;
the paralysis disappeared in twelve weeks; vision became
normal in three or four months; the dreams ceased after
seven months. The mood for the first two months after regaining
consciousness was slightly elevated; for another two
months slightly depressed. The mood then became normal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
There was, then, in this case complete recovery save for slight
overfatiguability in a period of seven months. There were
still a few residuals of hemiplegia. An operation in November,
1916, removed a shrapnel ball, one centimeter in diameter,
from a dural scar.</p>

<p>This is a case of acute reaction psychosis of exogenous origin
lasting three weeks and leading to complete recovery in an
after phase of from four to seven months.</p>

<p>Normal subject, wounded and thrown to ground by

WOUND, with pupil and pulse changes on pressure
of the scar.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 221.</b> (<span class="smcap">Bennati</span>, October, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A lieutenant of artillery, student (one of his brothers dead
of meningitis), suffered somewhat from diarrhœa on the battlefield.
He was, however, always able to obtain the best of
food. External conditions did not seriously interfere with
sleep. In particular there was no excessive dampness where
he was. He was preoccupied with having to act as substitute
for the commandant of the battery. He was not afflicted by
the thought of his parents far away; their financial affairs
were entirely satisfactory.</p>

<p>This almost normal man was wounded after a day of incessant
fighting five months after going to the front. When
firing ceased, he withdrew with his soldiers to a trench. Here
he was followed by an enemy gas shell which killed some and
wounded others. While outside the trench shifting mutilated
soldiers to the rear, he was hit by another shell of which a chip
wounded him in the left thigh. He felt a terrible spanking
blow that threw him to the ground and gave him great pain.
He was carried on a stretcher to the medical post across the
zone of fire; thence to a field hospital and from there to a
hospital further from the front. He had been for almost
seven hours in a sector of the fighting line which had been
almost continuously active.</p>

<p>The wound healed in less than a week. But what he had
seen and felt kept tormenting his mind. There remained
slight numbness in the wound where there was to be seen a
spot of pigment, the size of a two-cent coin, with somewhat
obscure outlines. The pain was irritated by damp weather,
in certain positions, and by touch, and the pain on pressure
was reflected in the pupils and in the pulse.</p>

<p>No other disturbance, organic or functional, was found.</p>

<p>Wounds; operation: Hysterical FACIAL SPASM.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 222.</b> (<span class="smcap">Batten</span>, January, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A 23-year old soldier was admitted to the National Hospital
for the Paralyzed and Epileptic, June 18, 1915, in the
following state: He sat in bed, gasping, with the left side
of the face set in a strong tonic spasm and jaws tightly set.
The contraction of the masseters was such that his mouth
could not be forcibly opened. He himself could separate
his teeth for about a half a centimeter, but the jaws came
together when a spatula was brought for insertion and then
failed to relax. The facial spasm increased as the jaw was
clenched more tightly. The patient said he was unable to
breathe excepting when sitting upright, and when put into
dorsal decubitus he breathed violently through his clenched
teeth and held his breath as long as he could, “assuming a
purple tinge,” as Dr. Batten states, “which was apt to be
disconcerting until one was accustomed to it.” Faradism
and force permitted the removal of false teeth but only to
the accompaniment of shrieks, foaming, and violent movements
of the arms, lacrimation, and sweating. During sleep,
the face was at rest. The spasm of left face and of jaw would
come on a few seconds after waking, when an observer was
perceived. Attempts to force the mouth open invoked the
same procedure as before in spite of the fact that the patient
ate well. In a month he was virtually normal.</p>

<p>It appears that May 13, about five weeks before, the
patient had been struck by shrapnel on the right hand, forearm,
and shoulder, and base of the nose, while in France.
He had been dazed but had not lost consciousness, and the
wounds had completely healed before arrival at hospital.
It was about a week after being wounded that the patient
was operated upon for removal of shrapnel from the face.
Upon recovery from the anesthetic, the patient found himself
unable to move the right side of the face. Unable to
remove his teeth, he had been fed by rubber tube.</p>

<p>Shell-shock: Hyperesthesia and over-reaction.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 223.</b> (<span class="smcap">Myers</span>, March, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A stretcher-bearer, 19, who had had 18 months’ service
and 6 months’ service in France, sent to Lieut-Col. Myers
the day after admission to a base hospital, showed a remarkable
condition of hyperesthesia and over-reaction.</p>

<p>It appears that four days before, he had been blown up
three times by aero torpedo mortar shells while attending
the wounded. One had blown him into the air, another had
blown him into a dug-out, and a third had knocked him down.
Two or three hours later, having finished the job of carrying
wounded to the dressing station, everything seemed to “go
black” in the dug-out where he was resting, and from that
time on he had been shaky. It seemed that he had hardly
slept for several days before he finally gave in.</p>

<p>There were irregular spasmodic movements of the head,
arms (especially the right), and legs (especially the left).
There were coarse tremors and incoördination in moving the
arms. With eyes closed, he touched his nose with uncertainty.
Cotton-wool touch on arms or head provoked lively
movements. “I was always ticklish,” he explained, “but
never like this; I can’t stand it, Sir.” Pinpricks produced
almost convulsions. There was perspiration, rigidity of legs,
and spasm such that knee-jerks were unobtainable. Plantar
reaction, flexor. There were also visual hallucinations of
bursting shells, and these were also heard when dozing.</p>

<p>Improvement followed with rest, but about two weeks
later, on waking to find himself being carried back to his
tent to avoid a shower, he was so terrified that a special nurse
became necessary. He was still jumpy the next day, alarmed
at footsteps, and afflicted with headache. He improved
further in three days; remained two months in hospital in
England, had one month’s leave, and then returned to light
duty.</p>

<p>Shell-shock; thrown against wall; comrades killed;
no visible trauma, or loss of consciousness: Persistent
TREMORS, augmented in intentional movements;
CRISES of agitation following noise or
emotion.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 224.</b> (<span class="smcap">Meige</span>, February, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A corporal (an expert gunner) and his squad had just entered
a mine shaft on Nouvron Plateau, January 13, 1915, when a
shell, bursting above them, threw him violently against the
wall and killed or wounded several of his comrades. The
corporal himself was not wounded, nor is it clear that consciousness
was lost. The man lay waiting on the ground for
some time until a communication trench could be finished
and he could be evacuated without much danger from the
mine shaft. He had already begun to tremble, and trembled
still more while going back in the trench.</p>

<p>He carried on there for a fortnight, always trembling, but
not eating and no longer able to handle a gun. He was evacuated
a month later and sent successively to Villers-Cotterets,
to Meaux, to Courneuve (a month), again to Meaux, and
finally to the neurological center at Villers-Cotterets, where
he remained for two months (April 13 to June 15, 1915).
Here he was given the diagnosis of hysterical chorea by Guillain,
and showed lively knee-jerks and Achilles jerks and great
emotionality. The tremors were greatly increased when the
cannon grew loud or bombs burst nearby. Lumbar puncture
here showed a perfectly normal spinal fluid. He was
then sent to the Salpêtrière, June 19, 1915, and was evacuated
July 13 to a civil hospital until September 24, whence he was
sent for convalescence to his home village, October 6 to
December 15, from which he was returned to the Salpêtrière.</p>

<p>Throughout these transfers there had been no change whatever
in his status. For almost a year, as the result of a shell
explosion, he had been trembling in precisely the same way.
All four extremities trembled equally, unless the right arm
and the left leg might be thought to tremble a bit more. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
tremor was equally pronounced in dorsal decubitus as in the
sitting or upright postures, but ceased during sleep. The
tremors were worse in the evening and it was hard for the man
to get to sleep. The eyelids and tongue showed a few irregular,
jerking movements, not synchronous with the tremor of
the extremities. The head showed few tremors. The patient
was able to diminish the trembling of the arms somewhat by
keeping the elbows flexed at a right angle and held firmly to
his body. If the tremor of the legs got more energetic, the
patient would get up and take a few steps. Any movement,
such as laying hold of an object, carrying a spoon or a glass to
the mouth, led to an exaggeration of the tremors in such wise
that the tremor of multiple sclerosis in its most extreme form
was recalled. It was very hard for the man to eat. If the
eyes were closed, the tremors grew more marked. The
emotion caused by sudden noise or sharp command or memory
of his trench life caused motor crises, with coarse, generalized
movements, and even loss of balance. This agitation grew
gradually less marked, but the tremors persisted. An attempt
to test reflexes led to violent generalized contractions.
There was no sensory disorder. The pulse was variable; at
rest it stood at 60; if a table near by was struck suddenly, the
pulse would go up to 120.</p>

<p>Sharp gunfire: TREMORS; TREMOPHOBIA.
A patient’s (an artist) description of his feelings.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 225.</b> (<span class="smcap">Meige</span>, February, 1916.)</h4>

<p>One of Meige’s victims of shell-shock tremors was an
artist. He stood the hardest sort of trench life for many
months without disorder. Under particularly sharp fire,
“the machine went off the track,” as the artist said, and he
began to tremble. Both arms and head trembled, but especially
the head, which was subject to small sidewise oscillations,
variable in degree, and almost permanent,&mdash;a sort of
vibration which the patient could diminish somewhat by
stiffening his neck muscles. His manual tremor was not
exaggerated by voluntary movements. Superficially he resembled
a Parkinsonian case. He presented a curious
appearance of combined vibrations and stiffness.</p>

<p>There was no doubt that this tremor had an emotional
origin. In fact, the psychopathic status of the patient was
described by the artist himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span> “My nervous state, which
I thought ought to last not more than a fortnight, still persists
more than three, or almost four, months after being
evacuated, although the trembling is a little less. I am
calmer and palpitate less, and my hands perspire less when
I am emotional or making an effort. At first, the slightest
shock immediately ran through me, followed by an uncontrollable
trembling. Now there is an appreciable delay between
the shock and the trembling; I can control it for a
few seconds but not longer. The subway gate noises, a
flaring light, a locomotive whistle, the barking of a dog, or
some boyish prank is enough to set off the trembling; going
to the theater, listening to music, reading a poem, or being
present at a religious ceremony, acts the same way. Recently
when a flag was being raised at the Invalides, I thought
at first that I was going to be cured by so moving a spectacle,
but then I suddenly began to tremble so violently that I
had to cry out, and I had to sit down, weeping like a child.
Sometimes the trembling comes on suddenly without any
cause. I went to a novelty shop to do some errands with
my wife. The crowd, the lights, the rustling of the silk,
the colors of the goods&mdash;everything was a delight to me to
look upon,&mdash;a contrast to our trench misery. I was happy
and chatted merrily, like a schoolboy on a vacation. All of
a sudden I felt that my strength was leaving me. I stopped
talking; I felt a bad sensation in my back; I felt my cheeks
hollowing in. I began to stare, and the trembling came on
again, together with a great feeling of discomfort. If I can
lean against something, sit down, or better, lie down, the
trembling gets better and pretty soon stops. There are three
conditions in which I feel well: first, upon waking after 11
or 12 hours’ sleep; next, after a meal, especially if it is a
good one; and lastly, and above all, when I get the electric
douche. Then, as if by magic, my ideas get clear, cheerful,
and regain color; I feel myself again. That lasts for an hour
or so; then I relapse into my sad state.”</p>

<p>As to the tremophobia, this patient says “In the tramway
or in the subway, I perceive that people are looking at me,
and that gives me a terrible feeling. I feel that I am inspiring
pity. Some excellent woman offers me her seat. I
am deeply touched; but if they look at me and say nothing,
what are they thinking of me? This anxiety makes me
suffer a good deal. If I am able to speak it is less painful
to me, for then it is obvious that, despite my trembling, I
am not a coward. What a sad situation this is!”</p>

<p>Meige remarks that therapeutics is not especially successful
in these cases of tremor. Sedative drugs, hyoscyamin,
hyoscin, duboisin, and scopolamin, do not last long
and should be used cautiously. Static electricity works well
in some cases. Rest, isolation, and calm.</p>

<p>As for the military prognosis, a period of observation of
some three to four months may be necessary to learn the
nature of the tremor. If the tremor then fails to alter, a
convalescent leave for one or two months may be given.
The patient should then be re-observed <i>by the same physician</i>.
Upon persistence of tremor, temporary invaliding. Tremors
may be wittingly cultivated for medicolegal purposes (Brissaud’s
sinistrosis.)</p>

<p>Letters of a German soldier about his shell-shock.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 226.</b> (<span class="smcap">Gaupp</span>, April, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A volunteer, 21, who had been in civil life a lackey, wrote
as follows upon arrival in Gaupp’s clinic:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“On account of our privations and the various terrible
scenes that you have to see, my nerves went
back on me. Like the rest of the front, we too had to
suffer terribly heavy artillery fire from December 20 onwards.
December 29 at eight o’clock in the evening,
when I was about to mount guard at the camp, I was
thrown down by a shell that unexpectedly struck near
me across the earth pushed out into a trench. I ran
at once to cover as some more shots followed directly.
I couldn’t be made to do anything on the thirtieth
nor can I very clearly remember the events of that
day. There was a terrific cannonade again, then cries
of the wounded and the sight of the dead, etc. I was
told afterwards that I fell down, cried, struck about
me, and remained lying, dazed. The first that I can
remember was that I was lying on a floor. I was then
carried into another house, into a better room. Then
I regained consciousness and could hear again after
the noise in the ears had stopped, but I could not talk
or walk. I was unconscious for two days. I got into
the hospital train at R. the next day but had to be
carried in as I could not walk. Travelling in the train
made me quite foolish in my head and gave me bad
headaches; I could not form any clear thoughts.”</p>

</div>

<p>It seems that this volunteer had not been quite up to the
hardships of the war from the beginning; always a weakling,
he had to be spared on the marches. In fact, he had been refused
by the army at the first examination as unfit. He had
been a nervous, tender, somewhat anxious fellow since childhood.</p>

<p>At the clinic there was an astasia and an abasia without any
signs of organic disease. The striking feature was mutism.
He could understand things spoken and written, but he was
entirely mute, nodding and shaking his head properly for
affirmatives and negatives. He carried with him a few slips<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
of paper with written requests, like: “Please, can I have salt;
otherwise I can’t eat the soup;” “Are we going to ride
farther, I have such a bad headache. The doctor must not
come. The one who wanted to shoot me if I couldn’t speak.
They are all bad.”</p>

<p>Treatment by suggestion (laryngeal faradization, lively
verbal suggestion to pronounce single vowels, syllables, and
whole words and sentences with enunciation of them) removed
the mutism in a few days. At first the man’s speech was low
and somewhat retarded, but later it became entirely normal.
Within ten days the abasia cleared up and the patient became
lively and cheerful. He was depressed on finding that he had
lice, but after losing them became happy and childlike again.</p>

<p>February 1, however, on learning that he would be able to
do garrison duty again, he took the news very soberly, and
grew more quiet, trembled and seemed anxious.</p>

<p>February 7, he was sent to the garrison, increasingly excited.
His own account of it in a letter written to a hospital
nurse, runs as follows:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As you will see, I did not reach Dn. but only got
as far as here [Another hospital]. I will tell you how
it happened. Probably I ought to have remained in
Tübingen for a while longer and perhaps then nothing
would have happened to me. You will remember that
I was more nervous and excited the last days than I
had been before, and the cause was also known to you.
I wanted to get home in some way and so I pretended
to be as well as possible. That crying attack, or whatever
it was [an outcry in a frightful dream] had not
been thought of by the physician any further, you know,
and so I didn’t think anything about it either. Then
the head doctor asked me once if I had any trouble left.
Well, I spoke out everything I had to say, but no further
attention was paid to that either. Then when I took a
walk and after walking slowly two hours could hardly
stand, was trembling all over and had a high pulse and
also a violent acute pain in the region of the heart, that
wasn’t of any importance either. Well, then I just got
better from day to day and so I got what I wanted only
too easily because they wanted the space and I certainly
would have gone home and not to Dn. as I should have.
[His reserve battalion was at Dn.] I got into the wrong
train at St. so as to go home. I kept saying to myself,
‘You can’t do that, it will be punished.’ Nevertheless
I couldn’t act any other way because I was really sick
from longing for home.”</p>

</div>

<p>Here he described an episode in a comrade who had lain
beside him in the clinic, had gone off with him and had
a hysterical excitement in Heidelberg so that he had to be
detrained.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I was so awfully sorry to see him so miserable. I
began to cry and was startled by every train coming from
the opposite direction and by every loud noise. I was
stared at by everybody in Frankfort and I could only
cry more. Then a soldier scolded me because I was
running senselessly up and down. Finally I got into
the Leipzig train. Another guard questioned me.
Everything then got more and more confused in me; I
heard my mother call; then I heard shooting again;
and finally I was entirely confused. I came to my
senses in a room in the station toward evening, and was
frightened again at a loud noise somewhere or a passing
train. Then I was told what I had done in the train.
I had cried out and raved, tried to get out of the car,
called for my father and mother, wanted to go home,
imitated shooting; allowed myself to be calmed a little,
but began to shout again at every loud noise. When I
was out of the train I bit a soldier and tore his whole coat
open, so then I was carried to the hospital here in an
auto. Up to this time I have been able to calm myself
very well. The physician said that it was quite natural
that I should not have very strong nerves yet. I must
have beaten about and got knocked against things a
good deal. There are bruises on my head and I am
covered with black-and-blue spots.”</p>

<h4><b>Case 227.</b> (<span class="smcap">Batten</span>, January, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A British soldier, 22 years, who went out to France in
November, 1914, remained well until March 12, 1915, when
after shell explosion, he became unconscious for half an hour,
and on recovery found he was deaf and dumb. He was able
to think of words but could not say them. He remained
dazed and frightened for a time, and still wakes up with a
start at night.</p>

<p>He was admitted to the National Hospital for the Paralyzed
and Epileptic, March 25, 1915, and on March 27 recovered
his speech suddenly and spontaneously. By March 29
he had completely recovered and talked well. Dr. Batten
remarks “how perfect the memory may be up to the time of
concussion, and how complete the mechanism is for expressing
the ideas in written words when that for spoken words
is abolished”; which may be seen from the patient’s own
account, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I went out to France on the 3/11/14 and I was two
days at Le Havre and then we went on to our 1st Batt.
When we arrived at our destination the regiment was in
the trenches so we had to go in. It was snowing hard
and I felt it very cold. This was at Givenchy. We
were relieved the following night and we went back
for a rest. The next place we went to was just opposite
Neuve Chapelle on the La Bassée Road and it was
awful, the trenches were up to the knees in mud and
water. The first night was very quiet, but the following
morning about 9 p.m. the Germans started shelling
and continued all day; the next was the same, but about
1 o’clock the Germans were seen to be coming up in
masses. They got to within a distance of about twenty-five
yards, then they turned. They commenced shelling
us again and they had another try about three
o’clock but they did not get far. One of the men on my
left had the half of his face blown away and we had
about ninety-two killed and wounded. We got relieved
after being in five days, then we went back for
three days’ rest. The next place we went to was Rue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
de l’Epinette and we had an awful time there just before
Christmas. We went into the trenches and we
were up to our middle in water and in some places it
would have taken you over the head. We were in these
trenches for twenty-four hours. There was nothing
unusual happened and we got relieved by the Royal
North Lancs.; but we did not get far away; we had just
got into our billets and were making some tea when
the fall-in went and we were told that the Germans
had broken through the North Lancs. We went away
without any great-coats, and into the trenches we went
for other seventy-two hours, and if the Germans had
attacked again we could not have fired a shot as we
were hardly able to stand for the cold and with the wet
kilts on our legs it was awful. We got nothing to eat
except three biscuits that some of the men went out
and got. When we came out of the trenches on Christmas
Eve we looked all like old men and a lot of them had
to be carried. We went back for a rest to (Nervaille?)
about thirty kilometers from the firing line for a month.
When we came back again we went to La Bassée and had
a pretty hot time there. The next place we were at was
at that big fight at Neuve Chapelle when 472 guns
bombarded the German trench for thirty-five minutes.
At about 7 p.m. the word was passed along that we were
to charge the German trench in front supported by
the City of London Territorials. We got the trench
all right and I got orders about 4 p.m. to go back to our
own trench and bring along the belt-filling machine
belonging to the machine gun. There was not a proper
communication trench, there was a small dry ditch that
ran out in the direction of the trench we had taken for
a distance of 150 yards, the other 100 yards you had to
come across the open. We got into our trench all
right, and I got this box on my back and started back
to the trench. I was just stepping out of the trench
when a shell burst just over my head and I went down.
When I came to my senses I was lying in our support
trench where I had been carried by two of the men of
the 4th Black Watch. One of them said something but
I could not hear him and I tried to tell him so, then I
discovered that I could not speak.</p>

</div>

<h4><b>Case 228.</b> (<span class="smcap">Léri</span>, February, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A number of chasseurs were doing the “tortoise-shell”
under bombardment, when the last chasseur in the line was
blown forward above his comrades by a shell bursting about
a meter behind him. He was projected some four or five
meters, got up, walked four or five kilometers, found an automobile,
and was carried to Nancy. He passed, according to
his story, red urine three or four times. He was six days at
Nancy, where a slight abrasion of the side was treated. He
began to feel heavy in his left leg on the fourth day. At
Vendôme, the paralysis got worse, and by November 17
he had apparently a complete paralysis of the left lower
extremity, called “spinal contusion.” He walked upon two
canes, dragging left leg behind and had to be carried upstairs
on a stretcher. The reflexes were normal except that there
might have been a very slight excess of the left knee-jerk.
There was a slight hypesthesia of the left leg, sharply limited
above.</p>

<p>These phenomena were strikingly modified, at a single
sitting, by verbal suggestion and faradism, but the man was
one of those with <i>mauvaise volonté</i>. He did not want to get
well so quickly, so that his complete cure was delayed a
while.</p>

<p>NATURE OF SHELL-SHOCK: At the nerve clinic

</div>

<h4><b>Case 229.</b> (<span class="smcap">Binswanger</span>, July, 1915.)</h4>

<p>The treatment of a German private, 22, for contracture of
the left leg and other phenomena, culminated in narcosis.
Binswanger lays stress upon the mental influence to be
exerted upon the patient at the conclusion of narcosis, at the
moment in which the patient is particularly accessible to
verbal suggestion. Treatment (see diagnostic details below)
was carried out as follows:</p>

<p>After a few days of essentially suggestive treatment with
continued attempts at passive movements of the contracted
joints (knee, ankle, toe), with steady concentration of the
patient’s attention upon the joints, a slight mobility in the
toe joint on passive movement was obtained.</p>

<p>After a few more days, the ankle became passively mobile
to some degree; the patient exerted a certain resistance to
passive flexion of toes and ankle. A week later, reflex contractions
of the toes could be evoked by deep pin-prick.
There had been an analgesia of both lower thighs and of the
soles of the feet, and this analgesia remained unchanged.
At this point, the subjective complaints of the patient,
namely, noises in the head, especially in the left ear, and other
cephalic sensations, tended to disappear and the patient
felt subjectively better; yet there was still an intolerable
itching of the head and spine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>A month after the admission of the patient to the nerve
hospital of the psychiatric clinic in Jena, there had been no
essential change in the immobility and contracture in extension
in the left leg. Accordingly, with the permission
of the patient, he was placed in deep chloroform narcosis, and
the knee-joint was bent at a right angle and fixed in approximately
that position with a bandage. This experiment
failed because, while the patient was waking out of his narcosis,
the leg slipped back into extension, breaking the bandage.
Accordingly, deeper narcosis was undertaken, and the
leg fixed at a right angle in a plaster cast.</p>

<p>While the patient was coming out of narcosis, it was
evident that he had been dreaming of battle scenes. In
fact, Binswanger remarks that these dream pictures and the
words spoken while going under and coming out of narcosis,
are curiously demonstrative of “<i>sympathy with the enemy</i>,”
for while waking out of narcosis, he cried: “Dost see, dost
see the enemy there? Has he a father and mother? Has
he a wife? I’ll not kill him.” At the same time, he cried
hard and continually made trigger-movements with his right
forefinger.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> In point of fact, throughout his waking treatment,
no one was able to learn what was going on in his mind,
his sleep was good and deep, and his emotional state was
entirely quiet and patient.</p>

Arinstein.) See also <a href="#case181">Case 181</a> (Steiner).</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>As the patient was coming out of chloroform and regaining
consciousness of his surroundings, he was repeatedly and
persistently assured that the bending of his leg was now
accomplished and the cramp removed. All that he would
now have to do was to get back the strength of his leg.</p>

<p>During the next few days he complained of violent pains
in his left knee-joint and in the ankle-joint, but he remained
in good spirits and full of confidence. Accordingly, in five
days the plaster was removed and the contracture in the
knee-joint was found to be completely absent; the knee was
easily movable. The ankle-joint was but slightly movable.
He could accomplish slight active flexion of the knee-joint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
while lying in bed, and the toe-joint had already, before the
narcosis, been both actively and passively mobile. After a
few days, exercises in walking were begun. The patient had
a little difficulty with his left knee-joint in walking, walking
in fact as if with knock-knee. The foot was not well raised
from the ground on account of the persistent stiffness of the
ankle-joint. Walking, however, improved daily. He walked
for three hours, resting at intervals.</p>

<p>A sensory examination showed that the upper limit of the
analgesia had come down five centimeters from its former
level, now occupying the left foot and leg up to the junction
of the lower with the middle third. There was now a zone
of anesthesia interposed between the normal skin of the upper
thigh and the anesthetic-and-analgesic skin of the lower
thigh and leg. Upon the posterior aspect of the leg, the
analgesia and anesthesia had disappeared to a point at about
the middle of the upper thigh.</p>

<p>About five weeks after the narcotic experiment, the extended
left leg could be actively raised while lying in bed,
up to the full extent, with slight tremors. The patient
described himself as fatigued by the active movements of this
leg. The ankle-joint remained less effective. There was
still a trace of resistance to passive movements. Although
the passive movements of the toes were normal, active movements
of these were weak and hard to execute. There was
still a trace of difficulty at the knee in walking and the gait
was awkward, trepidant, precipitate. He could get about
without a cane, however. If unobserved, his posture was
more certain and free. If he exerted himself hard, severe
parietal headache on the right side would develop.</p>

<p>It was then proposed to the patient that another narcosis
would rid him of the stiffness in his ankle-joint. He feared
narcosis and was told that regular and energetic voluntary
movements would also rid him of the stiffness. These will
exercises consisted in his directing his whole attention to his
left ankle-joint until he felt it. Then he was given the
command: “Let go the joint”&mdash;whereupon he would take
his attention away from the ankle-joint at once. In this
way, he was told, his will would make the ankle-joint mobile.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
Meantime he was given twice daily a gram of bromophenacetine
for his parietal headache.</p>

<p>The result was a rapid recovery. There were still a few
traces of difficulty at date of report. The zone of sensory
loss had retreated to the ankle, with a cuff-like zone of hypalgesia
above the definite zone of analgesia and anesthesia.</p>

<p>As to the previous nature of this case, although there was
neuropathic heredity on the mother’s side, there had been no
sign of any individual neuropathic disposition. He had been
a volunteer since 1911 in a guard regiment of infantry. His
military training had been well borne; in the war he had
fought through 20 battles. On November 11, 1914, in a
storming attack, he had had his breeches burned from the
effects of a shell. He had fallen, unconscious; the unconsciousness
lasted about eight hours. He found on awaking
that he had had nosebleed. When he wanted to get up, he
found that his left leg was completely paralyzed and insensible;
in fact, he thought it had been cut away. He crawled
for about three meters to a trench in which there were several
wounded. In the evening he was taken by automobile to a
field hospital, and on the 17th was removed to a reserve
hospital at Erfurt. Thence he was transferred to the Jena
Hospital, January 25, 1915.</p>

<p>A strongly built man, with many reflexes increased and a
lively dermatographia. The reflexes of the left, or contractured,
leg were lacking; the mastoid processes were painful,
and the occiput and temples were painful to percussion. The
spinous processes of the vertebral column in the lumbar region
were painful. The other phenomena have been sufficiently
indicated above. The head sensations were peculiar;
there were no pains but a peculiar itching. Contraction of
the fingers of the left hand was painful. There was a feeling
as if there were lice under the skin in the left upper thigh.
There was itching in the nose, which the patient described
as due to the sulphur “out there,” meaning shell gases.
Sleep and appetite were good. Memory was imperfect: he
could no longer remember the names of the battles, and of
late had had to count on his fingers to find out how much
was 2 times 2. As to the curious parietal headache, contralateral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
to the contractured leg, Binswanger inquires
whether we may not here have to do with localized vascular
phenomena of the brain part which might conceivably be
related with the innervation of the leg. Binswanger remarks
that if the plaster cast be left on too long, it may happen that
hysterical contracture will take place in the new position.</p>

<p>As to the will exercises used in the present case, Binswanger
remarks that the patients must be intelligent and
attentive, and naturally they must desire to get well. Fortunately,
many of the war hysterics do want to get well, since
the contrary experience is had in various industrial cases.</p>

<p>Wound of thigh: Pseudocoxalgic monoplegia with
anesthesia. Cure of anesthesia by faradism at one
sitting. Cure of lameness by reëducation and
electricity in one month.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 230.</b> (<span class="smcap">Roussy</span> and <span class="smcap">Lhermitte</span>, 1917.)</h4>

<p>An infantryman, observed at Villejuif, February 9, 1915,
was suffering from a right-sided crural monoplegia of a pseudocoxalgic
type, following a wound September 9, 1914. The
wound had been a through-and-through one in the upper
right thigh. Every active movement could be performed
as well on the right side as on the left; but the strength of
the movements was less on the right, especially that of leg-extension.
The reflexes were normal, the lameness was
slight, with toeing out; the sole came down flat upon the
ground. There was an absolutely complete anesthesia of
the entire right leg and side up to the umbilicus.</p>

<p>Energetic faradization of the skin caused the anesthesia
to disappear the day the patient was brought to the hospital.
The cure of the lameness required a month of reëducation
and electricity.</p>

<p>According to Roussy and Lhermitte, crural monoplegia is
less frequent than brachial monoplegia. The flaccid form is
rare, and when it occurs, complete, though the patient always
remains capable of executing some voluntary movements
and can walk with crutches or cane. During the
automatic movements of walking, some muscles may be
observed to contract that remain immobile when the patient
is being examined recumbent. Naturally such a difference
in contractions standing and lying, would be very exceptional
in a case of organic monoplegia.</p>

Cure of leg by psychotherapy.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 231.</b> (<span class="smcap">Babinski</span>, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A certain lieutenant, following contusion of the right
thigh, developed a crural monoplegia of hysterical nature.
In fact, although the paralysis had lasted several months, the
tendon reflexes, the skin reflexes, and the electrical responses
of the muscles, were absolutely normal. Moreover, the good
effects of psychotherapy confirmed the hypothesis. But
besides the hysterical crural monoplegia, there was a radial
paralysis on the right side, clearly organic in nature, due to
the nerve compression by the crutch which the patient had
employed on account of the paralysis of his leg.</p>

<p>Babinski notes that this association of conditions was
remarkable in that it demonstrated that hysteria and simulation
should not be confounded with one another. To be
sure, it is difficult to tell simulation from suggested phenomena,
for there are no objective characters that demarcate
the two. Babinski had himself said that hysteria was a
demi-simulation; but a demi-simulation is not a simulation.
The patient was in fact, sincere enough in his belief that he
could not move his leg. To obviate this paralysis, he had
in fact leaned so conscientiously upon his crutch that an organic
paralysis had resulted. In fact the radial palsy had
only been discovered incidentally, and the paradox appeared
that a purely imaginary trouble occupied in the patient’s
mind for a long time a much more important place than the
genuine organic trouble which accompanied it.</p>

</div>

<h4><b>Case 232.</b> (<span class="smcap">MacCurdy</span>, July, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A corporal described as normal (“except for some shyness
with the opposite sex”) adapted himself well to training and
went to France in May, 1915, where he was at once thrown
into 18 days of almost continuous bombardment. After
some initial fright, he settled down to work well enough, but,
when the weather got bad in September, 1915, grew tired of
the situation. Bad dreams began (falling into a deep hole;
being shelled). He thought of suicide, wanted a shell to
incapacitate or kill him, began to have pains in the head,
arms and legs, and was already groggy when a gas attack
came. Whether he got a whiff of the gas or not, he at any
rate felt giddy, got a swallow of water, and when the gas
passed got out of his dugout in the open air. He was fatigued
and much relieved when the company was ordered back.
Now, however, he got shaky and fell in a collapse on a pile
of straw, without, however, losing consciousness.</p>

<p>Apparently he had an attack of acute articular rheumatism.
There was a sore throat and a pain in the head,
radiating to left shoulder and to finger tips, with pain also
in legs. The pain was worse in the right leg on moving the
knee-joint. These pains lasted for a month in hospital.
The leg had been like a log since the collapse on the pile of
straw. Even after the pains left him a month later, the
right leg was paralyzed and anesthetic. He walked with a
crutch and developed a crutch palsy. After a month a
hysterical paralysis of the right arm, with superficial anesthesia,
supervened. During a period of eight months thereafter
improvement was steady under reëducative measures.</p>

<p>According to MacCurdy’s analysis, the acute arthritis led to
paralysis as a protective reaction. The paralyses are disabilities
that would ensure absence from the front.</p>

<h4><b>Case 233.</b> (<span class="smcap">Binswanger</span>, July, 1915.)</h4>

<p>N. H., 21, a laborer, industrious and sober (mother healthy,
father insane and a suicide; patient somewhat sickly in
childhood after pneumonia, a good scholar) volunteered at
the outbreak of the war. Early in November he was on the
Eastern front. November 17 to 22 he was in a number of
small reconnoitring skirmishes almost daily, as a cavalryman.
On the 22d, there was a clash with a Cossack patrol
of far superior numbers. Eight German horsemen cut their
way through, riding about 4 kilometers back to their squadron.</p>

<p>While dismounting, N. H. discovered that his back was
wet. It occurred to him at once that he had been wounded.
However, he successfully dismounted and then collapsed,
feeling as if his right leg had fallen asleep. His companions
found a wound in his back, which had come from a lance-thrust.
The wound was bandaged. He was transported to
Germany on a peasant’s wagon, the trip occupying six days,
and on December 6 he came to the surgical clinic in Jena.
The wound was insignificant and healed quickly.</p>

<p>The leg remained motionless, and on December 10 the
patient was referred to the nerve hospital. He was a small,
slenderly-built man, with poor nutrition, weighing 108
pounds. The scar, about 1 cm. long, alongside the thoracic
vertebra, was still somewhat red and but slightly sensitive
to pressure. Neurologically, the knee-jerks and Achilles
jerks were greater on the right than on the left, and there
was on the right side a distinct patella and ankle clonus.
There was no Babinski reaction on either side.</p>

<p>The movements of the right leg were not of wide excursion,
and flexion and extension of the knee and ankle-joints, while
lying on the back, were slowly and hesitatingly performed,
with an expression of pain, and with visible effort by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
quadriceps muscles. Flexion and extension of the toes were
likewise difficult, and when the toes were stretched there was
a distinct contraction of the tibialis anticus. Electrically
the muscles were normal. On passive motion, there was
slight spastic tension in the musculature of the right leg, and
the patient said he felt marked pain. In walking, the right
leg was moved with a limp and with the evident design of
sparing it. The knee was imperfectly bent and the sole of
the foot was dragged along the ground. There were short
out-throwing movements of the lower leg.</p>

<p>Pain sense was normal, or possibly slightly in excess.
There were painful points on pressure on the lower part of
the os sacrum and coccyx and over the right sciatic and tibial
nerves. Intelligence examination showed school knowledge
to be extremely poor and calculation ability poor. Critical
judgment and reasoning power were deficient. Memory
and perception were without marked disturbance. The
patient was dull and without interest in his surroundings.
He complained that his right leg was as if dead and that he
felt great pain in any attempt to move it. He also complained
of pains at night in the region of the right shoulder and neck.
His nerves, he said, had been very weak since his trip back
from the front, during which trip he had been very cold and
poorly cared for.</p>

<p>Treatment consisted of rest in bed, application of moist
packs to the right leg, active and passive exercises of the
right leg. After ten days he made his first independent
attempts to walk, and active movements of the right leg in
dorsal decubitus became unrestricted and painless. He remained
somewhat unsteady in station, showing bilateral
twitchings and movements of the right leg muscles. In
walking the right leg was dragged behind in a spastic-paretic
fashion. Appetite improved; spasms decreased; but at the
end of December foot clonus was still persistent.</p>

<p>Upon January 10 there was an odd mental change. He
became seclusive and suspicious. January 15 he expressed
ideas of poisoning; his sister, he said, wanted to poison
him, and others were watching him suspiciously; his room-mates
were talking about him; in fact, he thought one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
comrade was an Englishman. Sleep was poor. At the end
of January, after a short period of improvement, he again
had ideas of being poisoned, and had dream-like, unclear
thoughts. His actions became incoherent: he would undress
suddenly in the daytime and go to bed, getting up five
minutes later and dressing. Senseless postcards were written.</p>

<p>This condition lasted a few days only, whereupon the
mental and bodily condition greatly improved. Daily walks
were then taken in the garden and in the city without exertion.
The ankle-clonus on the right side was now decidedly
weaker but did not entirely disappear. The muscle power on
the right side was somewhat less than on the left.</p>

<p>The patient was very homesick, and on March 14 was
sent home.</p>

<p>Shell-shock&mdash;six days later, crural monoplegia,

HYPERSENSITIVE PHASE AFTER SHELL-SHOCK.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 234.</b> (<span class="smcap">Schuster</span>, January, 1916.)</h4>

<p>On August 13, 1915, a soldier was knocked unconscious
by the explosion of a shell nearby. He woke up several
hours later with headache, noises in the ears, itching, but no
trace of paralysis.</p>

<p>Six days later, on August 19, he was released from hospital,
still free from paralysis. On the railway journey he met
some people of his district by whom he sent greetings to his
wife, meanwhile becoming greatly excited. When he tried
to get out of the train he noted a weakness of the left arm and
left leg; this weakness somewhat quickly grew into a severe
paralysis, so that when observed in Berlin the left leg was
entirely paralyzed, not a single muscle of which could be
moved when the patient was examined by Schuster one
month after the accident. There was also a hypesthesia on
the left side with total anesthesia of the left leg, which
anesthesia was related stocking-wise to the hypesthesia of
the trunk. There was tremor of the hands as well as generalized
increase of reflexes. The plantar reflex, though weak,
was flexor. The pulse rapidly ran up under excitement. In
short, the patient seemed to be suffering from hysterical
palsy. Waking suggestion did so well with the man that
after three weeks normal sensibility was restored to the leg,
and he could walk tolerably well without a cane.</p>

<p>The point of interest in this case is that the symptom of
greatest importance, namely paralysis of the left leg, did not
arise until six days after the shell explosion and then only
after the man became excited by thoughts of his home and
family through meeting his town people. The term <i>metatraumatic</i>
is suggested by Schuster for cases of this sort. The
emotions and stresses of war may be regarded as <i>labilizing</i>
and <i>sensibilizing</i> the nervous system sometimes for months.</p>

<p>Wound of left foot: ACROCONTRACTURE.
Psychoelectric cure, about seven months later, at

</div>

<h4><b>Case 235.</b> (<span class="smcap">Roussy</span> and <span class="smcap">Lhermitte</span>, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A soldier, 21 years, was observed at the Centre Neuropsychiatrique,
August 30, 1916. He had been wounded in
battle, March 16, 1916, near the left internal malleolus.
Infection followed and inguinal adenitis, for which he was in
hospital a month.</p>

<p>Even before the abscess began, the foot had begun to twist
inward. After the abscess had been cured, a contracture
set in permanently, and at entrance to hospital was irreducible.
The knee-jerk and Achilles jerk were more active on
the side of the equinovarus contracture. There was even a
slight amyotrophy of the calf. There was no appreciable
vasomotor disorder. The foot and lower part of the leg were
a little warmer on the left side.</p>

<p>Cure followed a single sitting with psychoelectric treatment,
at least so far as the contracture went. Pain and
swelling remained in the evening, followed by fatigue. The
patient was discharged cured, October 12, 1916.</p>

<p>Hysterical pes equinovarus shows the foot immobile as if
frozen (<i>figé</i>). The foot is extended with the toes lowered
and the internal border incurved, as if revolved about the
axis of the leg. The surface of the sole is directed inwards
and much furrowed. The tendon of the tibialis anticus is
very prominent. The internal malleolus is hardly visible,
while the head of the astragalus is easily made out. No
passive movement is possible and the tibiotarsal and mediotarsal
joints are quite out of function. Upon palpation, the
excessive contracture of the anterior muscles of the leg is
striking. Upon request to move the foot, the foot is not
moved, but muscles of the lower leg may contract, and even
those of the thigh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>There were no sensory disorders in the present case, though
they often do occur in this form of acrocontracture. It is
doubtful whether the skin changes sometimes seen, such as
hypothermia, hyperidrosis, cyanosis, and glossiness are due
to circulatory disorder induced by the contracture or to the
prolonged immobility. It has been proved by Meige, Benisty
and Lévy, that even in a normal subject prolonged immobility
may cause a difference of temperature of several degrees.
Circulatory disorders sometimes cease immediately upon
cessation of the contracture. Roussy and Lhermitte insist
upon energetic and early treatment of these psychoneuropathic
acrocontractures, which are apt to proceed less
favorably than the acroparalyses. If not treated energetically
and early, actual nerve, tendon, and bone lesions may
ensue.</p>

from which he found himself suffering from a shell-wound in
the left buttock, complete paralysis of both legs, and pain in
the back, by the fourth lumbar vertebra. He thought that
he had suffered from sphincteric paralysis for eleven days after
the accident; but by September 25, there was no sign of
this. Besides the paraplegia, there was complete loss of sensation
below Poupart’s ligament in the right leg, reaching as
high as the iliac crest behind; and an anesthesia of the left
foot including heel and sole, with anesthesia to light touch
throughout the limb (pin-pricks being appreciated in a normal
way as far as the ankle); and there was an anesthesia to
touch and pain in the ulnar distribution.</p>

<p>April 20, 1915, the patient was found to be a robust,
somewhat microencephalic slowly cerebrating subject. Total
flaccid paralysis of legs; right knee-jerk slightly exaggerated;
no plantar response of any sort was obtainable. Right leg
entirely anesthetic; left leg and both arms showed a diminution
of sensibility; suggestion of glove and stocking anesthesia;
trophic changes absent. The scar of the healed
bullet-wound lay over the trunk of the left sciatic nerve.</p>

<p>It seems that the man’s companion had both his legs
blown off at the time the shell burst. It is questionable
whether the paraplegic patient actually saw the legs blown
off, or merely heard about the accident. Another psychic
feature lay in the fact that the patient had a paralyzed
sister&mdash;a possible financial burden.</p>

<p>April 30, nitrous acid anesthesia. During the temporary
rigidity, the legs were found to stiffen slightly; the legs were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
flexed. Upon the return of consciousness, the patient was
told that the legs had moved during anesthesia, and was
asked to place them in a more convenient position. The
thighs moved slightly, and throughout the day movements
were encouraged against resistance.</p>

<p>The next day he was gradually raised to the vertical
position and supported upright. But at this stage he had
become mentally resistant and resentful. During the day
the upright position was at intervals resumed, and the patient
was made to walk between two attendants. The next day
he walked alone and his mental resistance had broken down.
There was no longer any evidence of exhaustion and effort
in the movements, and the patient began to take pleasure in
his recovery.</p>

<p>Improvement was progressive. A pronounced hysterical
element persisted, encouraged by the perpetual attentions of
visitors. When discharged, there was a slight hemi-anesthesia
throughout the right side, and a doubtful patch of
anesthesia on the dorsum of the foot, sole, and plantar surface
of the heel.</p>

<p>Shell-shock; burial; flexion of spine: Paraplegia.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 237.</b> (<span class="smcap">Elliot</span>, December, 1914.)</h4>

<p>A reservist, 34, formerly army instructor in gymnastics, a
member of the 1st Battalion King’s Royal Rifles, was subject
to injury from the bursting of a “Black Maria” on his
trench. He was sitting with bent back in his shelter, with
legs fully extended. He was in a small dug-out, a recess
excavated under the earth backward from a narrow trench
and not timbered. The “Black Maria” burst and covered
him up to the chin in a heavy clay soil. After building up
the breach twenty minutes later, his comrades dug him out.</p>

<p>He had received on his body the violent impact of the mass
of earth pushed laterally from the crater excavated by the
bursting of the shell. Accordingly his vertebral column was
forcibly flexed, its ligaments were stretched, and hemorrhages
were produced in the great muscles of the back. As the
twelfth thoracic vertebra is the weakest spot in the spine,
the roots of the cauda equina opposite this weak spot were
probably injured. Such accidents are met in mines.</p>

<p>The legs were powerless and numb. There was nausea,
no vomiting, no gas, no dizziness or trouble in the head,
not even pain in the small of the back. The accident had
occurred at 8 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> Upon nightfall, he was removed on a
stretcher to the field hospital, arriving at the base hospital
four days later; and on the fifth day power began to return
to the legs. Knees, ankles, and toes would move slightly
November 6, though passive movements of the legs caused
pain in the back. The deep reflexes were weak, the plantar
reflexes flexor. The left cremasteric reflex was weaker than
the right. Impairment of sensation was slight in both extremities,
but the left leg was a little more numb than the
right. The left lower abdominal reflex was lost. A band of
hyperalgesia corresponded with the left eleventh and twelfth
thoracic segments November 12, slight reflex disorders and
some degree of paresis of the legs.</p>

<h4><b>Case 238.</b> (<span class="smcap">Hurst</span>, January, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A lieutenant, 23, came to the ambulance September 15,
1914, having the morning before been to the firing-line with
his company and thrown to the ground on his back by the
explosion of a shell which he had seen falling behind him.
He had not lost consciousness, but was unable to rise. After
a night in the relief post, he was brought by automobile 12
kilometers to the ambulance. He complained of pain in the
back, though no wound or ecchymosis could be found there,
nor any painfulness of spinous processes or irregularity of
bone. He had not emptied the bladder from the time of
the shock. Preparations were made to catheterize on the
morning of the 16th, when the patient after effort became
able to micturate. There was crural paraplegia such that
he could not sit or walk even when supported. Lying down,
he could move his legs slightly sidewise. Anesthesia to pin-prick
and temperature was complete to the groin; but tactile
anesthesia was found only in the sacral root territory, namely
in the feet, the outer aspect of the legs, the posterior surface
of the thighs, and the scrotum. There was loss of sense of
position for the toes. The plantar reflexes were abolished;
but there were no other reflex disorders; nor was there any
evidence of other disorder.</p>

<p>September 20, the man was evacuated by sanitary train
in the same status as at entry. January 27, 1915, the patient
could walk on crutches, supporting himself in part on the
left leg. The lumbar pain had largely disappeared.</p>

<p>Hurst regarded this case as one of organic origin due to

<h4><b>Case 239.</b> (<span class="smcap">Binswanger</span>, July, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A German soldier, 34 (non-alcoholic; married, father of
five healthy children; on military service 1901-3; regarded
as a very good soldier; father alcoholic), got bad leg pains
from wet and cold in West front trenches September 8-13,
1914. Still he was able to march some 30 kilometers. But
two days later (he had lain down in wet clothes in a barn),
his legs became quite immobile. He was in a reserve hospital
from November 3. The rheumatism disappeared, and
suddenly, early in the morning of November 8, when he was
washing, a lively tremor and shaking of the right arm set in.</p>

<p>Examination at Jena January 30, 1915, showed no special
physical disorder. The sense of touch was slightly diminished
on the right side; the pain sense was normal; movements
were free. While at rest there was a continuous
shaking tremor of the right arm and hand, which consisted
of very rapid pronations and supinations, and shaking movements
of the upper arm. At times the tremor would completely
cease, and when attention was diverted the tremor
became slighter or quite disappeared. The tremor increased
when it was talked about in the man’s presence. The left
grip was stronger than the right.</p>

<p>January 31, after he had been in bed one day and treated
with moist packs, the shaking suddenly ceased. He then
complained only of mild pains in the right shoulder and
wanted to get up.</p>

<p>February 23, he was given three days’ home leave, which
he stood very well. He now began to take part in the
medical gymnastic work, but complained afterwards of more
pains in right shoulder and arm. There was a lapse into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
shaking tremor, which lasted with varying intensity for
several weeks. Loud noises or calling made it worse.</p>

<p>Hypnotism and suggestive treatment of the tremor were
without effect March 25. March 26, on passive extension
of the right arm, patient complained of pain in shoulder and
arm. Next day the tremors were more marked, but March
29, the tremors suddenly stopped altogether. April 4, the
pains stopped never to return. April 15, he was given leave
to go home for spring farm work.</p>

<p>Four weeks later he returned, sparing his right arm, which
he held stiffly beside his body when walking. If he let the
arm hang free in walking, rhythmical movements in it began.
He complained of painful involuntary contractions in the
right arm even when in complete rest. Nor did the condition
afterward essentially change; the patient went home
at the beginning of July.</p>

<p>The remarkable feature of this case is the complete lack of
any emotional shock. The total genesis seems to have consisted
in the prolonged exposure to wet and cold, and the
heavy marching. The tremors, limited to the right upper
extremity, occurred without any demonstrable psychic or
bodily trouble, and set in after the disappearance of the so-called
rheumatic disorder. Although there is no one psychogenic
factor to single out, the psychic influencibility of the case
is unmistakable; moreover, the incompleteness of the cure is
doubtless, according to Binswanger, a matter of the imperfect
suggestive therapy employed.</p>

<p>Bullet wound of back: Hysterical bent-back&mdash;camptocormia.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 242.</b> (<span class="smcap">Souques</span>, February, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A man was wounded September 6, 1914, by a bullet that
entered along the axillary border of the scapula and emerged
near the spine. He spat blood for several days; but the skin
wounds quickly healed.</p>

<p>When he got up, his trunk and thighs were found to be in a
state of moderate flexion upon the pelvis, the trunk being bent
almost at a right angle; the legs were flexed somewhat upon
the thighs. The man could not voluntarily extend his trunk,
but he could extend his thighs to a moderate degree. He
could bend his trunk still further forward than its habitual
contractured position, being able to pick up an object from
the ground. If the man was put in the ventral position, the
trunk could be straightened to a considerable degree. Curiously
enough, the man felt no pain, nor had there been any
pain since the healing of the wound. No motor, sensory,
reflex, trophic, vasomotor, electrical, visceral, or X-ray disorders
could be found. It was evident that there was a
contraction of the muscles of the abdominal wall and of the
iliopsoas, yet it was also clear that these muscles were not
contractured on account of the subject’s ability to flex his
trunk and to extend his thighs.</p>

<p>Here, then, is a vicious attitude crystallized (in the phrase
of Souques) in the form of a pseudocontracture.</p>

<p>Blown up by shell; unconsciousness: Camptocormia

</div>

<h4><b>Case 243.</b> (<span class="smcap">Roussy</span> and <span class="smcap">Lhermitte</span>, 1917.)</h4>

<p>Camptocormia with antero lateral bending is described
by Roussy and Lhermitte in an infantryman observed at
Villejuif, February, 1915, after having been wounded September
3, 1914. The infantryman had been thrown into the
air by the bursting of a shell, had lost consciousness, and
came to with violent pains in the back. The trunk was
found to be bent strongly forward and to the right side, and
remained in this position thereafter. There was no evidence
of wound.</p>

<p>In February, 1916, a plaster corset was applied by Souques,
which brought the patient partly to normal station in three
weeks. The trunk was now no longer bent forward, but was
still bent to the right. A second corset was applied for
three more weeks, with which the patient became absolutely
straightened out again. He was discharged cured and sent
to the Grand-Palais for the reëducation course.</p>

<p>This condition is a form of trunk contracture in the nature
of a kyphosis (scoliotic and lordotic forms of contracture are
also found in the hysterical group), for which the terms <i>plicature</i>
of trunk, traumatic kyphosis, pseudo-spondylitis, and
camptocormia have been in use. The term camptocormia
has been proposed by Souques and Rosanoff-Saloff. The
<i>poilus</i> speak of the condition as <i>cintrage</i> (arching). In these
cases the trunk is held almost horizontally, with the head in
hypertension and neck muscles and thyroid cartilage jutting.
The patient looks fixedly straight forward, with eyes wide
open, and carries his legs extended or half flexed. The normal
folds of the abdominal wall are very deeply marked, and
at the level of the groins, the epigastrium and the pubis,
there are deep folds. Viewed from behind, the median
lumbar fold has disappeared or is faintly marked, as are the
sacro-lumbar and other masses of spinal muscles. The
whole lumbar region is elongated and flattened. The dorsal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
spines of the back are accentuated; the buttocks are flattened
and broadened transversely. The back of the neck is
marked by deep transverse folds, and the seventh spine does
not stand out. The patient can walk perfectly, though
sometimes there is a pseudocoxalgia and lameness. Attempts
to straighten the body lead to visible forcible contractions
of various muscles, but the kyphosis remains persistent.
There is a sense of active resistance on the part of the patient,
which can be demonstrated by palpation. If an active
attempt at straightening is made, lumbar or sacral pain
develops, followed by a very lively and emotional state of
anxiety on the part of the patient, with interrupted and
accelerated breathing, an expression of terror in the face, and
a rapid pulse. The patient then subsides into his earlier
attitude, and his anxiety disappears in a few seconds. It is
much easier in many subjects to reduce the camptocormia in
the position of dorsal decubitus than upright.</p>

<p>Burial after shell explosion; lumbar ecchymoses;

</div>

<h4><b>Case 244.</b> (<span class="smcap">Roussy</span> and <span class="smcap">Lhermitte</span>, 1917.)</h4>

<p>An infantryman was buried after shell explosion August
25, 1914, but he sustained no wound or bone injury. There
was, however, a large ecchymosis of the lumbar region, and he
had felt violent lumbar pains. The trunk was carried flexed,
symmetrically bent over and quite incapable of being
straightened completely. A plaster corset was applied March
16 by Souques. Three months of this was followed by a
complete straightening, which lasted after the corset was
removed. The patient was discharged well.</p>

<p>As to these cases of camptocormia, some authors regard
them as due to anatomical changes in the vertebral column
itself, or in the ligaments and muscles, and accordingly regard
the condition as a form of spondylitis, syndesmitis, or psoitis.
This view is held by Sicard, who bases the idea upon the
local pains and the results of cerebrospinal fluid examination.
According to Roussy and Lhermitte, hyperalbuminosis of the
fluid is extremely rare, and one case of their own <i>with</i> hyperalbuminosis
was nevertheless cured with great rapidity.
Roussy and Lhermitte even inquire whether the fluid albumin
may not be due in some way to an interference with venous
and lymphatic circulation.</p>

<p>In some cases, this condition may be at first a response to
pain, a pseudospondylitis dolorosa, such as may be sometimes
observed in hospitals near the front. Later, however,
the suffering in camptocormia is due more to the abnormal
position of the trunk, with strain upon vertebral ligaments,
than to the persistence of any original pain. Moreover,
these patients recover almost immediately from their pains
when the contraction is relieved.</p>

<p>In differential diagnosis, one has to consider, according to
Roussy and Lhermitte, Pott’s disease, traumatic spondylitis,
as well as Bechterew’s vertebral ankylosis, Pierre Mari<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>e’s
rhizomelic spondylosis, Kocher’s intervertebral disc contusions,
and Schuster’s myogenic ankylosis of the vertebral
column; but in Pott’s disease, the fixed pain points, rigidity
of column, fluid examination, and signs of myelitis, should
suffice for the differential diagnosis. Traumatic spondylitis
follows the contusion after months and after a phase of neuralgia.
Ankyloses do not so much concern the trunk as the
vertebral column itself; disc contusion produces disorders in
standing and gait as well as pains and edema. Schuster’s
disease shows paresis, hyper reflexia, and amyotrophy not
shown in camptocormia.</p>

<h4><b>Case 245.</b> (<span class="smcap">Joltrain</span>, March, 1917.)</h4>

<p>An infantryman in the Côte du Poivre was sitting on the
ground in the opening of a dugout eating soup, when a shell
burst and the roof of the sap fell in on him. The planks and
the stonework fell heavily on the dorsolumbar region. The
patient was almost bent in two, head to knees, legs buried,
hardly able to breathe. He did not lose consciousness and
cried out, feeling for a moment very anxious and fearful that
his comrades had left. Only two hours later was it possible
to dig him out. He said he had been absolutely unable to
make any movement, had kept his body bent, and felt violent
pains in the back. He was carried back twelve hours later
and reached the dressing station in eight more hours, eventually
reaching the neurological service two days and a half
after the accident. On entrance he was prostrated, complained
of lumbar pains and of inability to move, and was
able to make only a few contractions on the left side when
asked to try. The right leg was flaccid. The left knee-jerk
was stronger than the right. Other reflexes normal. Hyperesthesia
to pin prick on the right side. Slight saddle
hypesthesia, reaching to the iliac crests above and perineum
below with preservation of touch sensation. Slight forward
posture of vertebral column. The patient complained of
pain on pressure of the spinal processes and the lumbar spine.
There was slight ecchymosis about the left iliac crest.</p>

<p>Lumbar puncture showed clear fluid without hypertension,
in which were a few lymphocytes. There was a large amount
of albumin. The blood pressure was normal. There had been
a slight diarrhea following the accident which disappeared
on entrance to the hospital. The question was raised whether
the case was one of slight hematomyelia or was pithiatic.</p>

<p>Suggestive therapy was tried, and liquid was injected into
the muscles of the lumbar region and the posterior surfaces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
of the thighs. In a quarter of an hour the patient found himself
able to raise the foot above the bed. There remained an
extensor paralysis of the right leg. When the patient was
made to raise the foot he began to show the phenomenon of
Souques, called camptocormia. He could walk, nevertheless,
and took a few steps sustaining the weight of his body by
placing his arms on his thighs. Though he complained of
lumbar pain, it was finally possible for him to pick up an
object from the ground and lean sidewise. He could not,
however, stand up. Yet when the patient was made to lie
down, his back was spontaneously straightened. Treatment
of the camptocormia was also successful.</p>

<h4><b>Case 248.</b> (<span class="smcap">Nonne</span>, December, 1915.)</h4>

<p>An artilleryman (without hereditary or acquired neuropathic
taint) underwent much stress and strain in the war
in Belgium, Lorraine and Flanders. One night, on leaving
his observation post, he fell into a trench filled with water.
He felt pricks in the groin and gradually developed a pseudospastic
tremor of the lower extremity, paraparesis inferior,
depression, irritability, pressure sensations in the head, and
sleeplessness. He passed through three hospitals before
arriving at Hamburg and received the diagnosis of concussion
of the brain and cord.</p>

<p>Nonne found an emotional state of depression with hypochondriacal
fear, disturbance of sleep, deficient appetite,
constipation and pollakisuria. He walked upon two crutches,
dragging his legs inertly after him. There was marked cyanosis,
lowered temperature and hyperidrosis of the feet
and lower legs; exaggeration of tendon and skin reflexes
and pseudoclonus; no Babinski or Oppenheim reaction.
There was anesthesia of the lower extremities and of trunk as
high as the ribs. Pulse 130. Visual fields normal. Sensory
disorders absent.</p>

<p>After the first hypnotic treatment the patient was able to
stand and take a number of steps, and the tremor gradually
diminished. After two treatments standing became normal
and walking was much improved, the tremor ceased, cyanosis
and hyperidrosis disappeared, and the movements of the
bowels and urination became normal. Thereafter the patient
had no attention paid to him deliberately and in a
week’s time became well.</p>

<p>Here is a case in which, as Nonne states, the somatic
trauma required by Oppenheim as the basis of every traumatic
neurosis did not occur. Moreover, the sudden cures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
by hypnotism, or by any other method in these cases, warrant
us in supposing that there are no such fine molecular
changes as Oppenheim and von Sarbo assert. Such experience
as the cures in this group of cases confirms, according to
Nonne, the surprising result first achieved in this war (Bonhoeffer,
Wagner von Jauregg, Karplus, Wollenberg, Westphal)
that the most severe neuroses produced by somatic
and psychic traumata can be cured in an astoundingly rapid
manner without residuals.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> the controversy over Oppenheim’s traumatic neurosis,
Nonne holds with the Charcot school that traumatic neurosis
is clinically identical with hysteria. Oppenheim admits
the part played by psychogenesis, but has always laid a
greater emphasis upon the actual injury of the neuronic
apparatus in which he believes. He thinks that small hemorrhages,
inflammatory processes, and degenerative processes
affect the neurones unfavorably, and permit the psychogenic
effects to occur more readily. Of course the insurance-company
attitude and the attitude of railway corporations
saw malingering in all cases, and to this day,
neurologists are inclined to see a great deal of “indemnity
neurosis” in these cases. Opposed to the corporation men
and the neurologists were the psychiatrists, who chiefly
upheld an emotional theory of genesis&mdash;whence we began
to hear of the neuroses of fright and of accident.</p>

<p>Oppenheim claims to have established with war cases the
fact that an entirely normal person without heredity and
without antebellum acquired soil, may develop a neurosis
through war stress. Oppenheim concedes that there may be
purely psychic cases, but holds that there are nevertheless,
numerous purely physical cases and a great number of cases
of a compound nature, which are both physical and psychical
in their etiology. Oppenheim’s point is not that every
single symptom described <i>may</i> not be upon occasion psychogenic,
but that the data of this war prove that neuronic
injury, particularly injury of the peripheral neurones, can
also produce these effects. Nonne, Forster, Lewandowsky,
and others, opposed Oppenheim’s views vehemently. See
especially comments by Zeehandelaar.</p>

</div>

<h4><b>Case 249.</b> (<span class="smcap">Arinstein</span>, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A Russian private was buried after a shell explosion,
September 13, 1915, head down, so that only his legs stuck
out of the débris. Afterward his right hand refused to move,
and there was edema of the right wrist, with pain referred to
the shoulder joint. The head shook and made jerky movements
during the day, but ceased them in sleep. Speech was
retarded; words were uttered clearly enough but in a sing-song
fashion; sometimes the man stammered. Hearing was
diminished in the right ear. Pupillary responses were lively,
but the swallowing reflexes were diminished, and the corneal
and conjunctival reflexes were absent. The tendon reflexes
were lively on both sides. There were no pathological reflexes.</p>

<p>At the end of October&mdash;six weeks later&mdash;the patient
was sent home on convalescence for three months, and improved
rapidly after a short time in family surroundings.
He was examined again, two months after discharge, and
found normal in all respects. He returned to the ranks.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> Shell-shock in Russians, Arinstein concludes that concussion
hysteria may occur in a perfectly normal person,
yet be innocent of all organic signs indicating destruction of
peripheral or central neurones. Rifle or machine-gun fire
had not in his experience brought about concussion hysteria,
which was invariably due to the bursting of a large projectile.
With reference to Schuster’s remark that a sleeping man
never acquires hysteria from the bursting of a shell near by,
Arinstein confirms Schuster, finding amongst 2000 cases
no instance in a soldier sleeping at the time the shell burst.</p>

<p>Multiple wounds and bullet wound of palm: ACROPARALYSIS.
Cure, five months.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 250.</b> (<span class="smcap">Roussy and Lhermitte</span>, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A patient was observed at Villejuif, February 5, 1915.
He had been wounded, January 2, 1915, and showed scars of
a bayonet wound on the anterior surface of the right thigh,
of a lance wound on the dorsal surface of the right foot, and
of a bullet wound in the palm of the left hand.</p>

<p>There was left wrist drop with fingers extended. On the
sensory side, there was a glove anesthesia and analgesia up
to the bend of the elbow. The right leg showed a paresis
and contracture, but there were no sensory disorders in the
legs. Reflexes were normal. The patient was discharged
cured, in May, 1915 (psychoelectric method).</p>

<p>This is an example of the so-called acroparalyses, paralyses
limited to the hand or foot, many of which have developed
in this war, after grazing wounds or more severe injury.
More rarely they appear as if spontaneously. Sometimes
they are preceded by slight arthralgia or vague pains.</p>

<p>The condition in the hand suggests a radial paralysis. The
patient is unable to flex his fingers, though he probably is
able to make some movements with his thumb. Sometimes,
on request to move the hand, a series of coarse oscillations
follows, somewhat like a tremor. These oscillations are,
according to Roussy and Lhermitte, apparently pathognomonic,
and depend upon the contraction of the muscles antagonistic
to those whose movement has been requested.
These antagonistic muscles, themselves entirely incapable
of voluntary movement, are seen to be contracting effectively
and jerkily to meet the action of the agonists, also
seen making jerky movements. If the forearm is moved
passively and rapidly, the hand flops about inert, like the
hand of a marionette, although not to the degree of hypotonia
in organic paralysis. The hand is often cold, moist,
and cyanotic, and even possibly analgesic and hypesthetic.</p>

<p>Bullet wound of arm: Apparent radial paralysis,
not resolved by self-preservative swimming movements.
Paralysis actually hysterical.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 251.</b> (<span class="smcap">Chartier</span>, October, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A professional acrobat, 22, Corporal in an African Chasseur
regiment, was rather instructively tattooed and had apparently
performed some of his service in disciplinary companies.
In short, one might have a legitimate suspicion of the objective
value of any manifestations he might present. However,
one of his chiefs had written a favorable letter concerning
his services. He had had various crises of a hysterical
character since adolescence, and there was alcoholism in
the family.</p>

<p>He was wounded May 4, 1915, by a bullet which passed
through the outer and lower part of the right upper arm, and
thereafter the forearm and hand became completely inert,
both for flexion and extension. There was a considerable
hyperesthesia. The wound healed quickly, without complications.</p>

<p>August 5, about 10 o’clock at night, the man&mdash;then at
his dépôt&mdash;tried to commit suicide (motive not related with
the war). He threw himself into the Rhône from a height,
where the water was deep and the current rapid. His
brother and a comrade, who knew that he was going to make
the attempt, saved him. Chartier himself happened to see
the whole scene, and noted that throughout the affair the
forearm and hand of the patient remained inert. It seemed
as if there was a radial paralysis. This was the more likely
as the man had been wounded in the arm. First care was
given. The man had not known of Chartier’s presence. He
had been under water about two minutes.</p>

<p>From hospital he was evacuated three weeks later with a
diagnosis of radial paralysis, coming on service September 11.
Examination showed a slight paralysis of the extensors and
flexors of hand and fingers, and of the hand muscles. There
was also a slight contracture of these muscles, more marked in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
the flexors. There was pain upon reduction, with some jerking
of the muscles. Electrical reactions proved normal in
nerves and muscles. There was a segmentary anesthesia to
pin prick, reaching to the level of the elbow; deep hyperesthesia
of the finger joints. There was no trophic or vasomotor
disorder.</p>

<p>In short, here was a case of functional paralysis with contracture
of the right hand, to be regarded as hysterical in
the classical sense of the term, both by reason of the anesthesia
and absence of trophic disorder, and on account of
the hysterical history of the patient. Functional reëducative
treatment quickly improved the paralysis, so that two weeks
later the patient was able to extend fingers and hand. His
total recovery was hoped for, when, September 26, wishing to
get out of the hospital without leave, the patient jumped
from a window and broke his right leg. The functional
paralysis of the hand persisted and even grew more marked.</p>

<p>The interesting point in this case is that despite the powerful
nature of instinctive efforts with drowning persons, this
patient, subject to an hysterical arm paralysis, did <i>not</i> make
defensive movements with the paralyzed arm; yet this paralysis
was such as to be greatly improved by psychotherapy.</p>

<p>Bullet wound in brachial plexus region: SUPINATOR
LONGUS CONTRACTURE, hysterical-looking.
Callus of fractured rib probably at fault:
Treatment surgical.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 252.</b> (<span class="smcap">Léri</span> and <span class="smcap">Roger</span>, October, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A man was wounded, December 21, 1914, by a bullet which
entered about the middle of the spinous process of the left
scapula and was extracted a few days later from the posterior
border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, two finger-breadths
from the left clavicle, that is, at about Erb’s point.
The left upper extremity was inert for ten days, but then
began to move again, although extension and flexion of the
fingers did not begin at once.</p>

<p>October, 1915, movements were normal, except those of
extension of the forearm, due to contracture of the supinator
longus muscle, a contracture that had developed about three
weeks after the wound and stood out along the external
border of the forearm, almost suggesting a musculotendinous
retraction. There was a palpable, hard callus of a fractured
rib, presumably a cause of the permanent irritation of the
supinator longus, being precisely at the point where lesions
usually produce superior brachial plexus palsy.</p>

<p>Why should the supinator longus alone of the Duchenne-Erb
group be affected? Perhaps a single root was involved in
the irritative lesion. The biceps showed also a partial R. D.
The deltoid was normal electrically and in contraction.</p>

<p>The treatment planned for this case of isolated contracture
of the supinator longus was surgical operation of the
irritative focus. According to Léri and Roger, it is sometimes
dangerous to use such measures as massage and electric
baths for a paralyzed limb, since the massage or electricity
excite not only the affected muscles, but also the other sound
muscles,&mdash;muscles that are already more powerful than the
paralyzed muscles and may go into antagonistic contracture.
Even in limited galvanization, it is desirable to work with
weak currents, so as not to diffuse the current into non-paralyzed
muscles. In case of radial or sciatic paralysis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
apparatus permitting the extremities to rest without over-action
of the muscles antagonistic to the paralyzed ones may
well be applied.</p>

<p>We here deal with a case, therefore, which looked purely
functional, but in which careful examination and X-ray
served to show an organic focus of irritation.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> nerve concussion, Tubby offers the following definition:
Nerve concussion is damage to a nerve trunk without actual
destruction of the axis cylinders. The damage may consist
of an effusion of blood between the nerve fibres following
compression of a nerve against the bone by rapid passage of
a foreign body near the nerve. Sometimes, however, the
lesion which causes damage to the nerve trunk without
actual destruction to the axis cylinders is nothing more than
a temporary anemia or hyperemia. In most instances, both
motor and sensory function are together interfered with, but
in the case of large nerve trunks, <i>e.g.</i>, the popliteal, there
may be a separate concussion of motor or sensory bundles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter" id="case253">
<p>Contusion may effect a sort of STUPEFACTION OF
MUSCLE and paralyze it by a non-psychic process:
The SYNERGY in contraction of biceps and supinator
longus is thus SPLIT. Biceps restored to
synergy with the supinator by massage and faradism.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 253.</b> (<span class="smcap">Tinel</span>, June, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A man was wounded at about the middle of his biceps and
three weeks later was found to be able to flex the forearm only
by means of the supinator longus. The biceps remained
absolutely flaccid and soft, so that the diagnosis of a lesion
of the musculocutaneous nerve (unlikely as this seemed on
account of the low site of the wound) was entertained.</p>

<p>However, the biceps and the musculocutaneous nerve
proved electrically normal. In short, this paralysis of biceps
was functional in nature. But, according to Tinel, there
could be no voluntary suggestive or hysterical element in
such a paralysis, since flexion of the forearm is normally
produced by a synergic contraction of biceps and supinator
longus that cannot be separated voluntarily.</p>

<p>Treatment by massage and rhythmic faradization caused
the biceps function to return to normal, so that voluntary
synergic contractions of the biceps took place along with
those of the supinator longus.</p>

<p>We here deal, according to Tinel, with a genuine functional
paralysis, nonhysterical&mdash;a paralysis due to a kind of stupor
of the muscle. Such paralyses due to muscular stupor
ought to get well in a few days or weeks. Should they persist,
it is clear that a stuporous paralysis might be transformed
into a hysterical paralysis. In short, the direct contusion of
a muscle or group of muscles may be the point of departure
for various persistent paralyses.</p>

<p>Wound of arm: Blocking of impulses to certain

</div>

<h4><b>Case 254.</b> (<span class="smcap">Tubby</span>, January, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A private was wounded by a shell fragment, September
16, 1914, and admitted to the London General Hospital,
September 27. A high-velocity shell fragment had passed
through the soft parts of the left arm at a spot exactly corresponding
to the musculospiral groove. He could extend
the middle finger of the left hand, but the other fingers were
held in flexion. The last two phalanges of index finger could
not be moved, it was found, on account of severance of the
extensor tendon some years previously. Accordingly, the
loss of function due to the shell injury was that of thumb,
ring, and little fingers. Supination could not be executed
completely to the extent of 15 degrees; there was no R. D.
upon electrical test, October 2. The sensation of affected
fingers was woolly. November 3, the little finger had recovered,
but supination could not be completely executed.</p>

<p>The treatment consisted in a bent malleable iron splint,
with the wrist and affected fingers hyperextended. November
20 all power had returned with full supination, except
for the two phalanges of index finger previously injured.</p>

<p>Major Tubby thinks this a case of physiological blocking,
as from a small hemorrhage amongst the fibers or around the
nerve.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> inhibition, Myers thinks it is the functional cause of the
effects of shell-shock. He thinks it is not a fixation of the
<i>idea</i> of the paralysis of volition, but that it is a fixation
of the <i>process of inhibition</i> itself that produces the effects we
see in Shell-shock. It is a block of ascending paths that
produces the anaesthesia so characteristic of Shell-shock. It
is a blocking of sensory paths that produces mutism or
aphonia. But according to Myers, there is also a block in
certain cases of <i>descending paths</i> that control and coördinate
various mechanisms. The result of a block in the descending
paths is shown in spastic, clonic, or ataxic phenomena
of, <i>e.g.</i>, functional dysarthria. See also <a href="#case253">Case 253</a> (Tinel).</p>

<p>A Russian private, 24, sustained shell-shock April 14, 1915.
He was observed, when the shell burst, to crouch down, and
then to fall to the ground, unconscious. The unconsciousness
lasted about two days, after which he was found to be
oriented, though slow and stammering of speech, hardly
able to concentrate attention or sustain a conversation, and
giving the impression of a man stunned. There was difficulty
in the expression of thoughts, and a marked over-fatigueability.
After adding and subtracting accurately two-digit
figures for a time, the man quickly grew confused and
said that trying to solve such a problem made him dizzy.</p>

<p>His imagination was filled with gunshots, shell-bursts, and
the killing of comrades, and during any conversation the man
frequently shuddered. Concerning the shell-shock, he remembered
only that a number of shells had burst near him
and that he came to in the hospital. He kept looking to one
side and to a distance, as if listening, sometimes bending his
head downwards. He would cry and sigh during conversation,
and then be quite unable to explain why. He said
there were loud noises in his ears, and that his head and the
whole right side of his body felt hot. Pain was felt in the
left side of the head. The right hand and the right foot were
weak (on distraction, this hemiparesis remained unaltered).
Tremors affected all the extremities. He had a sensation,

on the skin of the left hand and foot. Speech was stammering.
There was a marked digital tremor, sometimes spreading
to the rest of the body during examination. The muscles
of the face, eyelids, and tongue showed sharp fibrillary twitching.
The pulse stood at 100 and frequently missed beats.
Battle hallucinations, visual and auditory, sometimes occurred,
the commands of superiors and the noise of guns,
rifles, yelling, and groans; the man would see trenches or
redoubts, or a field full of wounded soldiers or attacking
columns of the enemy. He recognized the hallucinations as
such. His sleep was troubled by nightmares of the same
general description.</p>

<p>For eight months the man had been in action at the front,
under heavy gun and rifle fire. He was a courageous man,

<p>A Russian Captain, 45 (heredity good; non-alcoholic, non-syphilitic;
always in good health) sustained shell-shock in a
battle in southeastern Prussia, August 13, 1914, and was
unconscious for two days. He was carried to one of the
provisional field hospitals, and then evacuated to Petrograd,
where during a period of four months, he was given electricity,
suggestion, and baths. He was feeling so much better
in December, 1914, that he went back to the front and headed
his company in the trenches. He stood only five days of
trench work, and was sent for mental examination December
29, 1914.</p>

<p>The captain was of middle height, well developed but
poorly nourished, of a dejected and preoccupied appearance,
looking to one side in conversation, and finding difficulty in
the expression of his thoughts. He talked almost exclusively
of his illness. He found difficulty in adding or subtracting
2-digit figures. He seemed to have amentia, frequently being
mistaken as to the most important dates in his life. He complained
of general weakness and inability to work. Any
endeavor to concentrate caused vertigo, irritation, and pains
in the head. Day and night he was troubled about his health,
his future, and his family’s future. He was going to become
an invalid and a burden. He was tormented with the idea
that people thought him a simulator. He complained of
lumbar pains. It seems that the explosion had affected the
left side of the body more than the right and he complained
more of pains upon that side. In the dark his gait was
unsteady, and he often had marked tremors of feet and
hands. In excitement the tremor would increase uncontrollably.
The patient thought that his hearing was diminished,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
especially upon the left side, and that his left ear
was weaker than the right. He slept poorly and had many
nightmares; his appetite was poor, and he was constipated.
There was difficulty in respiration; the pupils were slightly
dilated and sluggish in their responses. There was a marked
tendency to Rombergism; dermatographia marked; the skull
and especially the lumbar spine was painful on tapping;
hyperesthesia of the lumbar skin; paresis of left hand and
left foot. The tendon reflexes were more marked on the right
side than on the left, and there was even a slight ankle and
patellar clonus. The Babinski sign was present on the right
side. There were frequent fibrillary contractions of the
muscles of the trunk and back.</p>

<p>Objectively the hearing was somewhat decreased in the
left ear, and the vision of the left eye appeared to be somewhat
impaired also. If the eyes had been held closed for a time,
there was difficulty in opening them quickly. Aside from
a somewhat elevated pulse and slight cardiac arrhythmia,
there was no disorder of the internal organs.</p>

<p>This patient remarkably improved but was not absolutely
well at the date of the report.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> organic signs in Shell-shock cases, Oppenheim warns
practitioners and experts against undervaluing war neuroses.
He does not like to have them set down in too offhand
a way, as hysteria, wish-fulfilment, and simulation.
Hysteria is not likely, according to Oppenheim, in cases with
permanent cyanosis, disappearance of the radial pulse, trophic
disturbances, hyperidrosis, alopecia, fibrillary tremors,
myokymia, cramps, dilated and sluggish pupils, and weakening
of tendon reflexes. Hyperthyroidism also has been
found by Oppenheim.</p>

that he could not hold his reins with it; it shortly became
more painful. The left foot showed a tendency to the same
anesthesia and paresis.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, a number of punctate hemorrhages
appeared on the right thigh and lower leg, upon the outer
aspect. According to Gerver, these hemorrhages into the
skin of the <i>right</i> leg may have something to do with a disturbance
of circulation related with effects wrought upon the
<i>left</i> hemisphere. During the course of the disease, pains
occurred not only in the left arm and leg but also in the right
leg.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> brain injuries produced by shell explosions without external
wound, Roussy and Boisseau have not found a single
clinical instance amongst 133 cases observed, which suggested
cerebral softening, or even hemorrhage into the brain
substance, the cord substance, or the meninges. These 133
cases were observed in army neurological centres and contained
instances of (<i>a</i>) mental disease (confusion, delirium,
amnesia), (<i>b</i>) nervous disease (astasia-abasia, tremors, paralyses,
contracture), and (<i>c</i>) an intermediary group (either
mental confusion with stupor, or hysterical deafmutism).</p>

<h4><b>Case 259.</b> (<span class="smcap">Gaupp</span>, March, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A musketeer, 22, had been blind for a time at 11 on account
of some spinal cord disease.</p>

<p>He was a soldier up to Christmas eve, 1914, when he was
hurled backward in a trench in the Argonne by an exploding
hand grenade. He lay unconscious for several hours, though
without sign of physical injury. Coming to his senses, he
worked himself out of the trench and crawled to another, but
again fell unconscious. When he awoke he was in a physician’s
care in quarters, to which he had been taken by ambulance
men. Thence to the field hospital, and then to a
private hospital at B.</p>

<p>Upon admission, January 17, he was hard of hearing on
both sides, and his speech was peculiar: choked off and
retarded. His gait was heavy, on a broad base. He was
subject to headaches.</p>

<p>Exercises gradually improved the speech and the walking
disorder was quickly overcome. February 5 came a relapse
through fright at the rolling of drums near by. Speech was
completely lost, deafness set in, and the patient ran restlessly
to and fro in tears. After a few hours speech returned with
still some minor difficulty.</p>

<p>From time to time came fainting spells and attacks of
disorder of consciousness, with loss of orientation and the
idea of being in the trench or under cover. He would ask
whether it were raining through. His mood herein was at
times cheerful and excited. Speech further improved from
the middle of February, as well as did the other symptoms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>On the King s birthday, February 25, occurred another
relapse due to his hearing small guns fired: Apathetic stupor,
clonic spasm, aphonia, abasia, severe deafness, poor sleep,
refusal of food. The next day he was still mute, but the
spasms had ceased. He lay apathetically in bed, taking a
little liquid food. February 27 he was still mute, though
more active, not deaf, getting up alone, walking unsteadily
on a broad base, and playing cards at the table. March 2
the word <i>yes</i> was again enunciated. March 3 he talked more
freely and took a short walk. March 4 speech of a sudden
came completely back on the occasion of getting excited in a
quarrel among some other patients. The patient thereafter
began to talk a great deal, was bright and cheerful, but still
complained of a variety of nervous troubles. Speech was
somewhat difficult, but he was free from any definite aphasia
or paraphasia.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> Shell-shock deafness, Jones Phillipson states that concussion
deafness is due to three contributory factors: (<i>a</i>)
cerebral concussion, (<i>b</i>) fatigue (violent oscillation of the
perilymph, continued noises, strain of organ of Corti), and
(<i>c</i>) temporary or permanent disorganization of the conductive
apparatus.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> concussion deafness, J. S. and S. Fraser found in four
cases of actual explosion injury, a ruptured drumhead and
hemorrhage into the fundus of the internal meatus in three
cases. They did not find evidence of neuro-epithelial changes.
Possibly the fundus hemorrhages, besides giving rise to deafness,
may start up the tinnitus and giddiness that are sometimes
found. In one case, there were changes in the delicate
nerve endings of the auditory ampullae.</p>

<p>Shell-shock: Deafness</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 260.</b> (<span class="smcap">Marriage</span>, February, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A shell burst behind an English lieutenant in 1914 without
causing any wound but making him unconscious for an hour.
During the hour the Germans passed by and stripped him
of all articles of value. He came to and felt himself markedly
deaf in both ears with an intense headache. There was no
hemorrhage, no discharge, no tinnitus, no vertigo. Four
days after the shell burst he could hear spoken words on each
side at two feet, but could not hear a watch that could
usually be heard from 3½ to 4 feet. With tuning fork C air
and bone conduction proved much subnormal, though air
conduction was better than bone conduction. With tuning
fork C-5 air conduction was subnormal. Drums healthy.
Improvement followed; hearing became normal eighteen
days after explosion. The treatment was rest in bed with
bromides early and strychnine later.</p>

<p>Marriage states that the psychical deafness due to shell-shock
is usually bilateral and absolute. It is accompanied
also, as a rule, by other nervous signs and symptoms, such
as aphonia, tubular vision, paralyses, and anesthesias.
Milligan and Westmacott state that the deafness is due to a
functional suspension of neuronic impulses. They regard
the brain as in a state of physical fatigue, and the mind as in
a state of strain. There is no organic lesion. The neuronic
impulses which are temporarily suspended are those which
run from the higher cortical cells to the periphery.</p>

<p>Mine-explosion: Unconsciousness: Deaf-mutism.
Recovery of speech after epistaxis and fever.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 261.</b> (<span class="smcap">Liébault</span>, October, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A soldier, 24, teacher in civil life, was in a mine explosion
November 27, 1914, at Vienne-le-Château. He was unconscious
six weeks and remembered nothing of what had passed.
They had told him that he had been blind for a month. After
regaining consciousness he was a deaf-mute and for seven
months he did not speak. His mutism did not bother him,
as he thought he had always been mute. He had always been
able to write. He could not remember what had interfered
with his speech or tell whether he could think the words
which he could not utter.</p>

<p>May 22, 1915, there was considerable nasal hemorrhage,
with fever. Upon this day he began to speak, at first a few
words, telegram style, and with aphonia. A week later his
voice returned. He was very irritable during the period of
mutism and had ideas of persecution and of suicide and complained
of becoming easily fatigued and exhausted.</p>

<p>His voice, however, became completely normal again and
his respiration better. On the spirometer he breathed four
liters, but still got out of breath easily. His diaphragmatic
respiration was still imperfect. His deafness remained at
the time of report about as before, though he had now been
hearing for some time a slight resonance of his own voice and
could hear sounds emitted a few centimeters from his ear.
At time of report there was still general fatigue with insomnia.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> war deafness, Castex states that not merely shell
bursts and explosions are able to cause deafness, but the
din of battle alone. There are two big groups of war deafness:
one due to drum rupture, and the other due to labyrinthine
shock. Labyrinthine shock&mdash;a much more serious
matter&mdash;is produced when a big shell bursts. In these
cases, the labyrinthine disorder is simply of the same general
nature as <i>commotio cerebri</i>. The labyrinthine shock cases
often need to be retired permanently from the front.</p>

<p>Shell-shock: Deaf-mutism.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 262.</b> (<span class="smcap">Mott</span>, January, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A deaf-mute, 24, not of a neurotic temperament or of a
neuropathic predisposition, was admitted to the Fourth
London General Hospital November 16, 1915.</p>

<p>He wrote, “I left England the 8th of March, and went to
Gallipoli on the 26th of May, and about the middle of August,
one of our monitors fired short. I felt something go in my
head; then I went to the Canada Hospital. They said it
was concussion.” He had seen the monitors firing. He
came to in a dug-out about an hour afterward. He was quite
deaf and his head felt as if it would burst.</p>

<p>He could see and speak a little but lost his speech completely
when Barany’s tests were applied. The headache
then passed away, leaving the deaf-mutism. The ears, on
examination, proved normal. The patient was able to cough
and whistle. He wrote his wife a letter, telling her how he
killed a Turkish woman sniper, but he did not remember that
he had written the letter. Although he said he did not dream,
while asleep he would assume the attitude of shooting with a
rifle, as if pulling a trigger, and then the attitude of using the
bayonet: the right parry, the left parry, and the thrust.
Sometimes while asleep he would jump as if a shell were
coming, and he would catch his right elbow as if hit there.
He would then open his eyes wide and look under the bed.
Then he would wake up and begin to cry, but without sound.
Just such habitual attitudes occur in soldiers under anesthesia.
In hypnotic sleep, although he trembled at his trench experiences,
he did not assume these defensive attitudes.</p>

<p>Mott states in his Lettsomian lectures that hearing is
often absolutely lost, but that sometimes a man is absolutely
deaf on one side alone, either from the ruptured drum or
from the violence with which wax has been driven against
the drum. Mott speaks of the frequency of auditory hallucinations,
and of hyperacusis&mdash;part of the patient’s general
hypersensitivity&mdash;which may increase the violence of the
neurosis and especially aggravate the headache.</p>

<p>Shell-shock: Deaf-mutism; convulsions and dream.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 263.</b> (<span class="smcap">Myers</span>, September, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A private, 28, was seen by Lt. Col. Myers at a base hospital.
This deaf-mute wrote, “I was standing and a shell bursted
and that is all I can remember.” This might have happened
six days previously. The patient wrote vaguely about a
walk to “windy corner”; about being billeted in a dug-out,
a train journey, and another hospital. He was deaf, deficient
in sensibility throughout, especially in the left arm and left
side of the face, and had severe headache. Two days later
he started distinctly when hands were clapped while he was
writing, but at the next hand-clapping there was no response.</p>

<p>After Lt. Col. Myers wrote down, “Imitate me,” and made
consonant sounds, the patient succeeded imitating them.
“You hear me a little now,” Lt. Col. Myers wrote. “Is this
the first time you have spoken?” Patient replied, “I hope
the Lord I can get my speech.” “But you did speak just
now. Read this word. Say it.” Whereupon he was got
to say his name and number.</p>

<p>The therapy was proceeding properly when suddenly he
was seized with convulsions, limb movements chiefly clonic,
back arched, eyes starting, later upturned. The patient
pulled out a crucifix from a locker near the bed and regarded
it ecstatically (pulse 85, corneal reflexes preserved). Three
minutes later there was quieting down, and the patient was
induced to talk. He began to talk about his wife. He had
just been “seeing a farm and all the fighting.” A shell must
have come in there. He had “seen the Lord Who saved
him.” Intense headache and thirst followed. According to
the patient the excitement was due to recovery of speech.</p>

<p>He later said, “It was just like a dream when I came to.
I was sweating awful. I was seeing the Lord while I was in
the farm by the Captain. I dreamed that I had the cross in
my hand to meet him coming. I saw the trenches and the
dug-outs and the wife.” In point of fact, the Captain at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
farm had had his arm blown off, and he had found him lying
on the straw unconscious. Under hypnosis it appeared that
he had gone to a dugout from the farm and that at the
clearing station he had been “raving, seeing things, shells,
trenches, and things like that, sir.” A slow recovery was
made after evacuation to England. Seven months later he
returned to the front.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>This case appears to belong to the B group of mutism
cases, according to the classification of Myers, namely,
to the group in which the effects are psychical rather
than physical. According to Myers, whether mutism
occurs as an apparent result of physicochemical or of
mental causes&mdash;that is, as an A or a B case&mdash;it is
<i>actually</i> always the result of mental&mdash;that is, psycho-physiological
shock. Mutism in the A cases of physical
nature, where the shock must have been grosser and
more profound, generally proves more severe than in
the B cases. As to the appearance of unconsciousness,
apparently confirmed by the patients’ statements that
they “lost consciousness,” it is a question whether these
cases are not really cases of deep stupor. According
to Myers, the mutism is in nearly every instance
closely dependent on some form of stupor, being
generally the relic of such stupor after it has passed off.
Let the loss of consciousness be a profound stupor due
to the lifting or burial of the patient, then from this
stage there will be a transition to a state of ordinary
stupor in which intelligence is active but the patient
is unresponsive to stimuli. The patient is in a condition
called by Myers <i>excommunication</i>, in which the
inhibitory process may be regarded as protecting the
individual against further shock. As the stupor now
passes away, it is natural that the inhibition should
appear lost in the case of hearing and speech, which are
two main channels of intercourse with others.</p>

<p>Dumbness is, by far, the commonest disorder of
speech, occurring in about ten per cent of shock cases
in the first thousand cases of shell-shock seen by Lt.
Col. Myers. Stuttering and jerky speech have occurred
in about three per cent. Loss of voice is rarer.</p>

<p>As against the view of Babinski, that mutism, being
curable by suggestion, must have been produced by
suggestion, Lt. Col. Myers argues that the stupor preceding
mutism is the antithesis of suggestibility and is,
in fact, a condition of extreme <i>autofixity</i>.</p>

owing to sentry deck duty in bad weather. Two days after
the shelling of Scarboro,&mdash;December 16,&mdash;while in the
munition chamber of the big guns, he suddenly lost his voice.
He had been greatly upset during the firing of the guns. In
two weeks he recovered speech.</p>

<p>February 12, 1915, he returned to the hospital with a
complete aphonia. This was immediately after the naval
engagement in the North Sea. Three days later he was
treated with electricity directly applied to the vocal cords.
March 20 he was discharged with speech completely recovered.

he was very emotional, and felt noises in his ear, sometimes
humming, sometimes whistling. At Compiègne Hospital
a lumbar puncture was made, perhaps with a therapeutic
purpose, but this gave no results. The noises were
heard as a whistling <i>pseeee</i> followed by a <i>boom</i>,&mdash;an onomatopoeia
recalling the whistling and bursting of the bomb.
There was, in short, no labyrinthine lesion, but merely an

<h4><b>Case 268.</b> (<span class="smcap">Ginestous</span>, January, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A soldier of the Ninth Engineers, 28, a Beaux-Arts student,
was wounded, December 19, 1915, by stones and gravel thrown
in his eyes by a shell-burst. The eyelids swelled and the eyes
filled with tears. He was treated at the relief station and
then evacuated to Verdun. The edema disappeared in five
weeks, but it was impossible for him to look at light. February
2 he was evacuated to Nice, where he received the diagnosis
of traumatic keratalgia, blepharospasm, and photophobia.
After eight days’ leave he went back to his corps;
but the eye troubles persisted and he was sent to the ophthalmological
center at Angers, May 18, 1915.</p>

<p>Both his father, 67, and his mother, 58, were irritable and
odd. Three brothers and three sisters were also more or less
neuropathic, and one of the sisters had been in a hospital for
the insane with a persecutory mania. The patient had a
daughter, fourteen months, well.</p>

<p>The man was a nervous, impressionable person, who wept
at the slightest emotion. With an effort of will he could
open his eyes, but if one tried to open them passively there
was stout resistance. In the dark the occlusion was not so
complete. Both eyelids were wrinkled and folded and made
jerky, fibrillary movements. The conjunctiva and cornea
were normal (fluorescein test), but the palpebral conjunctiva
was red and injected. The patient said he had subcutaneous
pains recurring at irregular intervals above and below the
left orbit, brought out or exaggerated by pressure; but such
pressure had no effect upon the lid movements. Visual
acuity was normal, but the use of ophthalmometer was
impossible, as was measurement of the visual field. There
seemed to be no disorder of chromatic sense. The reflexes
could not be fully examined; knee-jerks preserved. There
was a zone of anesthesia to pin prick, less marked to heat,
on the whole left side of the face. W. R. negative.</p>

<p>A man in the third Wiltshire regiment was buried in a shell
explosion and struck by a large mass of earth on the back of
the head. When dug out, he was found blind. It was
thought at the time that the severe blow at the back of the
head had “concussed” the occipital cells for sight.</p>

<p>Some months later the man was sent to Mr. Pearson’s
home for blind soldiers in London; but two months later was
returned to Weymouth, under Greenlees’ charge. He thought
himself worse, since now he could not see light at all. He
had trained himself to take care of himself and steered confidently
aside from obstacles in walking about. He was able
even to learn the various colors by the sense of touch, according
to Greenlees; thus, blue was diagnosticated against red:
according to the patient, a piece of colored card always had a
rougher feel if it was blue than if it was red. In fact, his work
consisted of making colored net bags.</p>

of hysterical blindness appears to be decreasing as the war

contraction of the visual fields. The condition is much less
frequent than that of deafmutism.</p>

<p>Shell-shock amblyopia (composite data).</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 270.</b> (<span class="smcap">Parsons</span>, May, 1915.)</h4>

<p>Parsons describes a typical case of shell explosion amblyopia.
After more or less prolonged fatigue from marching
and trench exposure, the soldier is knocked down or blown into
the air, and more or less severely injured or wounded by
concussion, fracture, bullets, or shell splinters, losing consciousness,
but perhaps not enough to prevent automatic
walking in a dazed state to the dressing station. Memory
of this phase is lost. The man is instantaneously stricken
blind, possibly also deaf; and possibly smell and taste are
also lost. Blepharospasm is intense; there is lacrimation;
the lids are opened with such difficulty that examination of
the eyes is almost impossible (nor, according to Parsons,
have the pupils yet been examined at this stage).</p>

<p>In a week or two the blepharospasm diminishes, and the
fundi, which are found to be absolutely normal, can be
examined. The eyes may be found to be quite normal, the
pupils reactive to light though perhaps sluggishly and perhaps
unequally. Sight is now somewhat restored, light can
be perceived, and large objects distinguished. The patient
can grope about and usually does not stumble against obstacles.
The fields of vision are markedly contracted, and
more so than the avoidance of obstacles in walking would
suggest.</p>

<p>Vision is eventually recovered completely. The right eye
(the shooting eye) is often more deeply affected and recovers
more slowly. Perhaps a central scotoma may persist.
Sometimes on manipulation of lenses the full vision can be
produced for the types. Parsons seeks to explain the psychology
of traumatic amblyopia in the light of deductions of
Lloyd Morgan, Mark Baldwin and McDougall.</p>

flashes, fear, disgust, fatigue).</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 271.</b> (<span class="smcap">Pemberton</span>, May, 1915.)</h4>

<p>Pemberton calls attention to the following factors in a case
of amblyopia: First, excitement during a prolonged and somewhat
critical attack; second, overstimulation of eyes and
ears due to brilliant flashes, night firing from many batteries
close together (the gunners are always subject to temporary
deafness from this firing); third, natural fear from close bursting
of shells; fourth, disgust at decapitated and disemboweled
soldiers; fifth, fatigue from twelve hours’ work.</p>

<p>The artillery sergeant worked under heavy shell fire at
Gun No. 1. A direct hit killed three men serving No. 2 gun.
The sergeant became somewhat excited but worked his gun
until the following dawn, when he collapsed across one of the
disemboweled corpses. He thus had been at work for about
twelve hours. The battery had fired 400 or 500 rounds.</p>

<p>A few hours later, the man was conscious but very feeble
and much shaken. There was amblyopia and contraction
of the fields of vision to rough tests, but no change in color
vision. Taste sense was blunted, and salt could hardly be
told from powdered quinin tablets. Smell also was practically
absent, although he had never been able to smell
accurately. Hearing was not more affected than that of
other men in the battery, and there were no tympanic fractures.
Both thighs, from about the apex of Scarpa’s triangle
to the knee, showed partial anesthesia, such that a pin prick
that should have been painful was felt only as a tactile sensation,
whereas lighter stimulation caused no sensation whatever.
The patient himself complained of numbness in these
areas. The gait was slow and spastic. The knee-jerks were
brisk. Sent back to the wagon lines for a week, the patient
lost his sensory disturbance, but the symptoms of mental distress
increased. He walked weakly and stiffly; he continually
thought of the dead men at the next gun, one of whom
was a friend. He was finally sent to a hospital in England.</p>

<p>Shell-shock amblyopia.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 272.</b> (<span class="smcap">Myers</span>, February, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A private, 20, lay in the booking-hall of a station, October
28-29, not securing much sleep; motored in a bus next day
to another place at 7.30 p.m.; went into billets at 8 p.m.;
mounted guard 10-11.30 p.m. and 1.45 to 3.45 a.m.; and
went to the firing-line for the first time at 11 a.m. October 31.
The platoon advanced through two sets of trenches, which
were full, and had to retire. About 1.30 p.m. they were found
by the German artillery.</p>

<p>This man had been rather enjoying it and was in the best
of spirits until the shells began to burst. The platoon was
retiring over open ground. He was kneeling on both knees,
trying to creep under wire entanglements, when two or three
shells burst near by. Three more shells burst behind and
one in front. The escape was described by an eye-witness
as a miracle. He managed to get back under the entanglements
and into the trench, and shortly, as the fire slackened,
rejoined his company.</p>

<p>His sight had become blurred immediately after the shell
burst. Opening his eyes hurt him, and the eyes burned when
closed. The right eye “caught it” more than the left. At
the same time, he was seized with shivering, and cold sweat
broke out, especially about the loins. He thought the shell
behind caused the greater shock, like a punch on the head
without pain. The shell that burst in front had cut his
haversack away, bruised his side, and burned his little finger.
This shell he thought caused his blindness.</p>

<p>He was led to the dressing station by two comrades, opening
his eyes to see where he was going but finding everything
blurred except immediately after opening his eyes. There
was no diplopia. Objects seemed to dissolve. He was
weeping and worrying about becoming blind. The horse
ambulance took him to a hospital and thence to another
hospital, and thence he went by motor ambulance at night
to the starting point, where he arrived five days after he had
entered the field. He could remember nothing about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
ambulance trips. There was a slight deafness which soon
passed off. In hospital he shivered almost incessantly in
bed, and he kept thinking about his experience and the shell
bursting. The shivering ceased November 3. No micturition
from the afternoon of October 30 until the afternoon of
November 2. No movements of bowels from October 30 to
November 5.</p>

<p>It seems that this soldier had been for two months in the
Aisne district, sleeping badly on account of lumbar pains and
toothache. There had been albuminuria, and the patient
said he had failed to pass a medical examination. The fields
of vision were found to be distinctly contracted. There was
difficulty in taste and smell, which the patient said he had
lost since the shell-burst.</p>

<p>Hypnosis was tried but the patient “insisted on resisting.”
The suggestions were offered during the concentration
period. November 13 taste and smell began to return and
the fields of vision were less contracted. He was transferred
to England for further treatment, and by November 27 had
become much improved and not so “nervy.” February 1 he
had begun to attend hospital as an out-patient.</p>

<p>SHELL WINDAGE (NO EXPLOSION): Multiple
affection of cranial nerves.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 273.</b> (<span class="smcap">Pachantoni</span>, April, 1917.)</h4>

<p>August 22, 1914, a French officer was leading his company
to an attack and carried on, though wounded in the side by a
bullet. Suddenly he felt as if he had received a terrible blow
with a hammer on the left cheek and eye and as if his arm
had been torn off. He fell to his knees without losing consciousness.
<i>There had been no explosion</i>, and none of his
soldiers had been hit. He felt of his arm and carried his
hand to his head to make sure of the wounds. There were
none, but he was bleeding from the nose and the mouth.
His left eye was closed and his left cheek drawn “by an invisible
hand.” His tongue had swollen until it had to be
pushed out of his mouth. He was breathing hard. He fell
upon his side without losing consciousness and he was carried
by his men to shelter in a trench. Placed on his back he felt
that he could not lift his head as “it had become too heavy.”
His voice was lost. He could neither cough nor spit. In
order to get air he had to remove bloody saliva from his
mouth with his finger. The left side of the head was swollen.
On opening his eyes he could no longer see with the left eye.
His cheek was covered with ecchymoses but without wound.
A few hours later he was made prisoner by the Germans.
For two months he had an increase of temperature every
evening and for three months he lost his voice. Six months
later there was still visual impairment. He was anesthetic
in the left cheek, unable to chew, paralyzed in the left facialis
region. There was alteration of taste, with atrophy of the
left side of the tongue deviating to the paralyzed side, and
nasal regurgitation. There was continual drooling and convulsive
coughing. In dorsal decubitus the head could be
lifted with difficulty. There was a kind of paresis of the
esophagus, as he felt the bolus stop at the level of the third
ribs so that with each mouthful he had to swallow a little
water. Apparently he had a paralytic state of the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
nerves: optic, oculomotor, trigeminal, glossopharyngeal,
pneumogastric, spinal accessory and hypoglossal. There was
evidence of a slight old tuberculosis at apices. The man was
slightly pale. There was an atrophy of the optic nerve and
some retinal swelling. No pupillary reactions to light on the
left side; but the accommodation reflex and sensory reaction
were preserved. Divergent strabismus of the left eye. The
taste on the left side and on the anterior part of the tongue
was slightly diminished. Diminution of galvanic and faradic
excitability on the left side of the face. No reaction of
degeneration. Bitter, salt and sweet tastes altered. Left-sided
atrophy of the tongue. No reaction of degeneration
in the tongue and thyroid muscles although there was a
marked diminution in faradic excitability.</p>

<p>The author records this case of multiple lesions of cranial
nerves as due to shell windage. Thirty-one months after the
onset of the paralysis the cranial nerves, although manifestly
regenerated, had not regained conductivity. The officer was
examined by Pachantoni at Louèche-les-Bains in Switzerland.</p>

clonus, after other reflexes (including conjunctival)

the new formula of THE PHYSIOPATHIC SYNDROME
(BABINSKI).</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 274.</b> (<span class="smcap">Babinski and Froment</span>, 1917.)</h4>

<p>Babinski examined in August, 1915, at the Pitié, a soldier
who had been wounded in the upper and outer part of the
thigh. He showed a most marked claudication with outward
rotation of the foot. There was a muscular atrophy of the
thigh but no appreciable disorder of the electrical reactions.
There was a slight limitation in the movements of the hip,
namely, the movements of flexion and internal rotation of
the thigh upon the pelvis; yet this limitation of movements
did not seem to be in proportion to the rest of the motor
disorder. The X-ray showed no joint lesion. The right
knee-jerk was a bit stronger than the left, though this was
controversial. Achilles reflexes were normal and equal; epileptoid
trepidation of the foot, and clonus of the patella
absent; the limb showed marked and permanent vasomotor
disorders and local hypothermia; both phenomena were of a
sharp and definite nature.</p>

<p>On the basis of the intensity of these vasomotor disorders,
Babinski felt that, in accordance with his general ideas, he
was not dealing with hysteria, and that he was in fact dealing
with the so-called physiopathic syndrome. Lacking for this
syndrome was the exaggeration of the tendon reflexes of the
affected limb. Might it not be that the improper attitude
and muscular stiffness of the limb were based simply on retractions
of tendons? The patient was chloroformed. This
procedure was the more warrantable as a number of physicians
had thought of the patient as an exaggerator or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
even as a simulator. Under chloroform there was in fact
a slight tendon retraction; yet on the whole it was clear that
the attitude and stiffness of the limb were largely dependent
upon a contracture. When during narcosis all the other
tendon reflexes and skin reflexes had become extinct, there
was still to be observed on the affected side a hyperreflexia,
and even a clonus of the patella; and the clonus lasted an
hour after recovery from the anesthetic. This curious
phenomenon of elective exaggeration of tendon reflexes in
narcosis, Babinski has observed to be not infrequent. It is
a valuable diagnostic sign for a sure proof of excess tendon
reflexes in cases where doubt prevails under ordinary circumstances.
Sometimes the contracture will yield, but only
in the deepest sleep, outlasting even the conjunctival reflex
and the reactions to pricking of the normal extremities.
Moreover, the contracture would return from 20 to 25 minutes
before any manifestation of consciousness. If an endeavor
was made to reduce the contracture under full anesthesia and
in complete unconsciousness, a spasmodic movement was
provoked which exaggerated the abnormal attitude of the
limb. Sometimes even the leg would be thrown into flexor
contracture.</p>

<p>The case above described was the one which led Babinski
to his new formula of the <span class="smcap">Physiopathic Syndrome</span>. This
he describes in general terms as follows:</p>

<p>These disorders consist in post-traumatic contractures,
paralyses or paretic states, but are not attended by any of
the signs of the so-called organic diseases, either of lesions of
the central nervous system, or of the peripheral nervous
system, or of the great arterial systems. In fact, these disorders
somewhat resemble hysterical manifestations. The
underlying lesions appear to be sometimes extremely small;
in fact, so minimal as to be out of proportion with the functional
disorders that they produce. These disorders do not
correspond with any known anatomical regions, but they are
singularly tenacious, and, unlike truly hysterical (pithiatic)
phenomena, they are completely resistant to suggestion. Yet
it is not merely in resistance to suggestive therapy that
these reflex disorders differ from hysteria; for besides the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
contracture and the paralysis or paresis found in the different
segments of the extremity concerned, the complete Babinski
syndrome includes also muscular atrophy, exaggeration of
tendon reflexes, alterations of skin reflexes (even amounting
to areflexia), hypotonia, mechanical over-excitability of the
muscles with retardation of the muscular contraction;
quantitative changes in electrical excitability of muscles
(excess or diminution without R. D.), mechanical over-excitability,
and occasionally electrical over-excitability of
the nerves, disturbances in objective and subjective sensibilities
(anesthesia and pains), heat regulation disorders
(especially hyperthermia), and disorder of the vasomotors
(cyanosis, skin redness, oscillometric lowering at the periphery
of the extremity in the presence of low temperature),
secretory disorders, and various trophic disorders of the bony
system, the skin, and the nails.</p>

<p>Despite the permutations and combinations of these
symptoms, according to Babinski they amount to a new
group of disorders and represent a nosological species: a
species of disease phenomena that lies midway between the
organic affections and hysterical disorders. Babinski proposes
the term <i>physiopathic</i> for these phenomena, a term
which excludes the connotation of hysteria and all forms of
psychopathia, on the one hand, and seems, on the other, to
express the fact of their correspondence to a physical material
perturbation in the nervous system of a novel sort.</p>

in extension followed, with a flaccid paralysis of the great toe.
The left knee-jerk was a little stronger than the right; the

difficult on account of contracture of the foot.</p>

<p>Chloroformed, October 22, 1915: There was no sharply
defined asymmetry of the tendon reflexes. The left Achilles
reflex appeared a little weaker. In the phase of muscular
resolution, the contracture disappeared entirely, but it reappeared
a little after the return of the tendon reflexes. The
reappearance of the <i>contracture preceded</i> the reappearance
of <i>consciousness</i> from twenty to twenty-five minutes.</p>

<p>A typhoid patient, October 20, 1914, showed phlebitis and
abscess of the right buttock with contracture of pelvic trochanteric
muscles. He was sent to the Pitié on medicolegal
grounds.</p>

<p>September 22 there was found a slight laxity of the patella
tendon, as well marked on the left side as on the right. The
right side was more cyanotic, due to the inactivity of the limb.
There was no edema. Tendon and skin reflexes were normal.
The lack of power was diagnosticated as purely functional,
and the report was rendered that the soldier could begin to
walk as soon as he desired. The two knee-jerks were noted
to be stronger and polykinetic, and the right knee-jerk appeared
a little stronger.</p>

<p>The patient was chloroformed, October 25, 1915. Almost
immediately, the knee-jerks, Achilles jerks, plantar, and
cremasteric reflexes disappeared. During the first period of
anesthesia, there was no accentuation of the reflexes, but at
the beginning of recovery the anticipated reappearance of
the <i>right</i> knee-jerk was observed. This knee-jerk was already
sharply defined at a moment when the left knee-jerk was still
abolished. In a later phase of recovery, the right knee-jerk
was very markedly exaggerated and a patellar clonus was
demonstrable on the right side. Even percussion of the <i>left</i>
patellar tendon brought about a contraction of the <i>right</i>
adductors. There was a true clonic and tonic spasm of these
muscles. On the other hand, percussion of the right patellar
tendon was able to provoke no contraction of either right or
left adductors. Nor was there at any time any ankle clonus.</p>

<p>Hysterical lameness (bullet wound of calf) cured,

<h4><b>Case 277.</b> (<span class="smcap">Vincent</span>, April, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A corporal was wounded by a bullet in the calf, September
8, 1914. At the end of July, 1915, his lameness continued and
he disliked to lean on his left leg which bent under him. There
was a slight atrophy of the left calf. The lower leg could not
be extended upon the thigh if the foot was in dorsal flexion,
and the dorsal flexion of the foot was itself limited. There
were no reflex, vasomotor or electrical disorders. The man
was given the usual treatment by Vincent and soon learned
to carry his body on either foot, and, being well disposed,
speedily abandoned his lameness, acquiring such skill in
movements that he became monitor over the other soldiers,
watching over them in his capacity as corporal.</p>

<p>For about a year he thus served as monitor, and when fully
dressed did not seem abnormal or look as if he were walking
lame. However, after walking, say 6 kilometers, rapidly, he
dragged his leg; nor was extension of the lower leg upon the
thigh absolutely complete in habitual walking, though he was
able to extend perfectly if requested. Dorsal flexion of the
foot was also still somewhat limited, and the measurements
of the two lower extremities at both calf and thigh showed a
persistent slight atrophy on the left side. He was then sent
into the auxiliary service and did good work as draughtsman.
In the winter the left foot got cold rather easily.</p>

<p>This case is instanced by Vincent to support the contentions
of Babinski and Froment that the truly “physiopathic” or
“reflex” disorders do not completely clear up in the recovery
from the associated hysterical disorders. That limb, which is
the seat of physiopathic disorder, is not in a state of meiopragia.</p>

<p>Clovis Vincent examined a man who had been wounded in
the foot but without injury to the bones. He was first
examined in July, 1915, when he complained of foot pains and
was walking with crutches. The left calf was smaller than
the right (4 cm.). The tendon reflexes were normal. There
was no abnormality of electrical reaction. There was no
proportionality between the trouble with walking and the
organic status. A large part of the trouble appeared to be
hysterical. In fact, upon treatment, the man was soon able
to abandon the crutches and to walk, though lamely. He
was put into the auxiliary military service.</p>

<p>However, the pains grew more marked and the lameness
increased. Incapable of working, the patient was sent to
the neurological center at Montpellier, whence he came to the
neurological center at Tours in September, 1916. He had
never been confined to bed, and had never ceased his daily
walking, aided by a cane. The walking disorder was very
pronounced. The patient said he was still suffering much.
The difference between the two calves was now 8 cm. and the
thigh was atrophied, though the atrophy had been absent in
July, 1915. There was hyperexcitability of leg muscles.
The right foot was colder than the left. The hysterical phenomena,
so pronounced in July, 1915, were now absent, yet
the reflex phenomena were sufficient to invalid the man.</p>

<h4><b>Case 279.</b> (<span class="smcap">Roussy</span>, April, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A foot chasseur, 22, a farmer in civil life, sustained shell-shock
<i>à distance</i>, June 2, 1915. He had no wound, but lost
consciousness. He was evacuated for “contusion of back”
to a hospital June 4 to 12; for “contusion of back and <i>commotio
cerebri</i>” to Portarlier, to July 21; for “internal contusions
and <i>commotio cerebri</i>” to Besançon, where he was
in three hospitals up to May 31, 1916, and the diagnosis
“hysteria, old <i>commotio cerebri</i> and trepidant astasia-abasia”
was rendered and psychotherapy tried. The man
was then evacuated to Saint Ferréol and the diagnosis “hysterical
paraplegia” rendered. He finally reached Veil-Picard
in February, 1917, still victim of paraplegia.</p>

<p>Up to this point there had been no signs suggestive of
organic lesion of the spinal cord or any hysteroörganic intimation
whatever. But in February, 1917, besides the motor
disorder there was a hypothermia of several degrees, with
cyanosis and hyperidrosis of both feet, with a marked diminution
(and absence on one side) of the plantar cutaneous
reflexes. The man was also victim of “hysterical pregnancy.”
The cyanosis, hypothermia and hyperidrosis lasted six weeks.</p>

<p>March 23 the man was given treatment and for the first
time in 21 months was able to stand and walk. The foot
now turned from blue to red, and instead of cold became
warm, even hot. In about a week the hyperthermia diminished,
and, with the other troubles, disappeared. There
remained only a slight swelling of the foot and ankle joints,
due to the painful exercises given the patient.</p>

<p>It would seem, then, that a hysterical paraplegia of long
duration may finally associate itself with marked vasomotor
and secretory disorders and that these may be altered with
extreme rapidity on the very day in which the hysterical
phenomena are removed, and quite disappear in a fortnight.</p>

<p>Tetanus clinically cured: Phenomena in part reproduced

</div>

<h4><b>Case 280.</b> (<span class="smcap">Monier-Vinard</span>, July, 1917.)</h4>

<p>An infantryman, wounded at Notre Dame de Lorette, May
9, 1915, by a shell fragment in the right popliteal space, was
given a preventive injection of 5 c.c. of antitetanic serum,
evacuated to a hospital, May 12, and developed signs of
tetanus August 1, with trismus and pains and spasms in the
right leg.</p>

<p>The disease progressed with dysphagia, stiffness and paroxysmal
hypertonia of the legs, especially of the right leg,
fixed orthotonus of the trunk, neck hyperextended, arms stiff
but able to move. Antitetanic serum was given daily. At
the end of eight days there was a marked improvement and
the whole course ran to approximate recovery in 25 days from
the onset of tetanic symptoms, at which time the man was
able to get up and walk on a crutch. The external popliteal
nerve had been sectioned, and the foot was in a marked
equinovarus.</p>

<p>Chloroform was administered for the purpose of straightening
the foot, September 2, that is, about five weeks after the
apparent end of the tetanus. The first stage of the anesthesia
lasted about two minutes, but at this point the trunk and leg
muscles passed into a state of diffuse contracture. In fact,
a <i>tetanic syndrome</i> took place <i>in the midst of the anesthesia</i>.
At a time when the corneal reflex was completely abolished,
it was still impossible, with the exertion of the greatest
strength, to flex the segments of the lower extremities.
Moreover, the trunk was stiffly extended and the jaws were in
trismus. Tonic and clonic contractions were produced by the
efforts made to straighten the foot, and these contractions
passed from the right side to the left. The chloroform was
now increased and a transient resolution of the muscles was
obtained, lasting hardly more than a half minute. As all
efforts to reduce the pedal deformity failed, anesthesia was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
stopped. The contractures and paroxysms lasted a few
minutes. The knee-jerks were extremely exaggerated and
there was a bilateral ankle clonus. After a brief phase of
excitement, the patient emerged from anesthesia, began to
talk with his comrades, and ate his usual meal without inconvenience.
The chloroform anesthesia had lasted twenty
minutes, and 60 grams had been administered.</p>

<p>It was now determined to section the tendo Achilles and
the tibialis posticus. September 8 the man was chloroformed
again and the same phenomena were exactly reproduced.
Sixty grams of chloroform was again administered.
The tendon resections permitted placing the foot in the proper
attitude. Next day the patient was examined neurologically.
The skin reflexes were found normal. The Achilles
and knee-jerks were somewhat exaggerated, but equal on the
two sides. There was no ankle clonus. Sensations proved
normal. There was a mechanical hyperexcitability of the
muscles of the anterior aspect of the thighs and of the calf.</p>

<p>In another case chloroformed 17 months after recovery
from tetanus no such phenomena appeared. It would
seem that the impregnation with tetanic virus or toxin must
last in the nervous system a good deal longer than the apparent
disease clinically lasts, but that this belated and concealed
intoxication eventually passes.</p>

<p>The phenomena are perhaps <i>analogous to</i> those of <i>Babinski
and Froment’s</i> so-called post-traumatic physiopathic or
<i>reflex phenomena</i>. It was following the special work of
Babinski and Froment upon the use of chloroform anesthesia
in detecting physiopathic conditions that Monier-Vinard

<p>A soldier of the class of 1917 who never went to the front,
while in training at Belfort, felt violent emotion on the occasion
of the falling of a big shell in the town of Belfort. The
explosion was a good distance from him. He lost consciousness
a few moments, February 23, 1917, and almost at once
found himself unable to move his left side. He was hemiplegic
three months, but his leg shortly regained power.
December 23 he entered a neurological center with his arm
flaccid and a paralysis affecting the shoulder also. There
was an almost complete anesthesia of the arm terminating in
segmentary fashion about the shoulder, and the whole of
the left side was slightly hypesthetic, although there was no
disorder of motion except in the arm. The tendon reflexes
of the left arm were exaggerated, and there was even contracture
upon percussion of the muscles themselves. Percussion
of the thenar and hypothenar eminences produced
movements of the hand. There were several vasomotor
disorders. Percussion led to large vasomotor plaques, and
rubbing of the skin produced a reddening which passed away
slowly. The hand was red and cold. Slight electrical hyperexcitability
of flexors with feeble galvanic current; excitation
of the extensors not associated with any contractions of the
antagonist muscles. Threshold lower for flexors on the
affected side in the forearm. Half centimeter atrophy of the
biceps. The forearm and hand were possibly slightly increased
in volume from a blue edema of the dorsal surfaces.
The man was very timid, complained little, and accepted all
treatment, which, however, was not very effective. This is
presented by Ferrand as a case with physiopathic disorder
in the sense of Babinski and Froment, though it does not
present any sign of organic lesion whatever.</p>

<h4><b>Case 282.</b> (<span class="smcap">McWalter</span>, April, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A soldier was picked up insensible in the public street and
brought to hospital by ambulance, unconscious, breathing
stertorously, pupils dilated, lips parched, unresponsive to
stimuli, but without signs of injury or alcoholism.</p>

<p>The pulse grew slower, the respirations more sighing, the
heart-beat more diffused and labored; but towards evening,
about eight hours after admission, he began to move the
eyelids and lips, and muttered a response to the request for
his name. After ten more hours, respiration grew better,
and Croton oil led to a movement of the bowels. Natural
sleep intervened, and 18 hours after the onset of unconsciousness,
the man woke up, and in the course of a few days
became fairly well though still dazed and confused.</p>

<p>This soldier had never received any definite injury in his
war service, but McWalter attributes his break-down to the
effects of the constant shocks from the bursting of shells, and
the scattering of shrapnel.</p>

<p>McWalter generalizes that a soldier, in the course of some
civil occupation <i>after</i> the war, might develop symptoms, even
fatal symptoms, and still the death in the case would be a

<p>A soldier became blind, deaf and dumb, as well as paralyzed,
as a result of shell explosion. When he arrived at the hospital,
he was able to see but had visual hallucinations. In a
few days he recovered his hearing. There was a fine tremor
of the hands, controllable by suggestion. There was an
almost complete amnesia, but the patient remained able to
read and write.</p>

<p>The pain persisted several months. The patient was
physically well and seemed perfectly intelligent despite his
aphasia and amnesia. One night, he sprang out of bed, shouting,
“The guns are coming over us!” and from that time
forward was able to speak. Amnesia, however, supervened
for the months in the Dublin Hospital, and the patient
believed that he was still in France. He also became unable
to read or write, and was unable to recognize any letters
except those he had been taught to speak during his period
of dumbness. Still later he got a flaccid paralysis of the legs.
From seeming perfectly intelligent, he began to seem markedly
deteriorated. Hypnosis with waking suggestions had no
power upon him. After a time, intelligence reappeared, but
there had not been any recovery of locomotion at the time
of report.</p>

gassed twice, and buried under a house, in each instance being
treated in the field ambulance and returning to the trenches.

fall upon his shoulders might be too much for him.” He
thought his intelligence had been numbed by his experience.
He thought his memory was unreliable, and that he could
understand neither complex orders nor even the newspapers.</p>

<p>As to the reason for his maintenance of composure at the

<p>A Belgian was wounded, October 21, 1914, at Dixmude.
The bullet wound was just below the right mastoid process.
He was admitted to the London General Hospital, October
29. He said that the bullet had passed into the tonsil,
lodging there, but that on the third day, while vomiting, he
brought up the tonsil with the bullet in it. There was in
fact a large ragged wound at the site of the right tonsil. He
could swallow fluids only, but articulated clearly. There
was a question of injury to the following nerves: facial,
glossopharyngeal, vagus, hypoglossal, spinal accessory, and
sympathetic. None of these nerves, however, appeared
actually to have been injured. The difficulty in swallowing
was due probably to the faucial wound, and it is hard to see
how the pharynx could have been involved on account of
the perfect articulation. November 3 the right sympathetic
nerve was slightly affected; the right pupil was smaller than
the left although it reacted to light. November 12 the
patient left the hospital and nothing further is known of his
history. Thus there was a late effect upon the sympathetic
nerve thirteen days after the wound.</p>

<p>Fall from horse under shell fire: Crural monoplegia,

<h4><b>Case 286.</b> (<span class="smcap">Forsyth</span>, December, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A patient of Forsyth had been exercising a high-spirited
horse. Artillery fire close by made the horse leap sidewise,
and the rider fell, his back striking the ground. He seemed
to be curiously shaken out of proportion to the gravity of
the fall. In a day or so, he lost the use of one leg.</p>

<p>He recalled a rather similar incident: He had taken a hand
in a local uprising in a distant quarter of the world. While
he was escaping up a mountain track, a rifle-shot from the
enemy brought down his horse, which rolled over and threw
him violently against a boulder, where the small of the back
met the force of the impact. He felt intense pain and lost
consciousness. Upon recovery he found he was paralyzed.
At the end of several days, in a hiding-place in the rocks, he
found himself still unable to move his legs. The friend who
had carried him to the hiding-place refused to leave him.
He thought of suicide, but then discovered that he could
move: at first, the big toes, then the ankles, then the knees,
and finally the hips. He was finally able to get into the saddle.</p>

<p>Moreover, years before, he had heard that a man who
broke his back was paralyzed in the legs.</p>

work in hystero-organic cases not precisely as in hysterical
cases. Autosuggestion may here replace or accompany the
ordinary heterosuggestion. Some temporary disturbance&mdash;a
slight pain, a trivial injury, or a mere bruise&mdash;may start up
a complex process of autosuggestion in which it may be difficult
to unravel the part played by the patient’s own reflexes,
his previous experience and beliefs (in this case, the reminiscences
of a similar accident), the solicitude of his friends,
and the medical examination itself. Babinski believes that
hysterical paraplegia or monoplegia never appears automatically
under the influence of emotion; never appears after the
manner of sweating, diarrhea, or blushing.</p>

<h4><b>Case 287.</b> (<span class="smcap">Myers</span>, March, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A private, 26 years old, had 11 months’ service and one
month’s service in France. He arrived at a base hospital
the day after his shock. Concussion had caused the dug-out
in which he was standing to collapse. A beam struck him
on the left side of the face, and pinned him to the ground on
his right side. A piece of iron fell on the left side of his back,
and his right leg was pinned by a cross beam on the back of
his thigh. He was dazed by the shock; was released and
was able to walk, but complained of a pain in the right groin
and a giving-way of the right knee. The medical officer
arrived about an hour later. A numbness, or state of no
feeling, in the right thigh appeared, and increased to the
point of total analgesia to the level of the upper margin of the
patella save for a narrow strip in the mid-line on the posterior
aspect of the leg. The only area of complete anesthesia and
algesia was on the outside of the lower half of the leg.</p>

<p>According to the patient, it seems that about three years
before, he had been buried four feet deep in a brick yard,
beneath a heap of clay. He had felt it most in the right leg,
but the thigh had been merely stiff and sore, and not numb.
The patient admitted that the present accident immediately
reminded him of his previous experience. There were no
tremors or sensory disorders in the face, arms, chest, back,
or abdomen. There was diminished sensibility to cotton
wool of the left buttock (across which a plank had fallen),
and there was a degree of hypalgesia of the buttock. The
right thigh showed a degree of thermanalgesia and slight loss
of vibratory sense. The corneal and conjunctival reflexes
were diminished, and the knee-jerk was unobtainable on the
right side. Three days later, there was a marked improvement
with almost complete return to normal, whereupon the
patient was sent to a convalescent camp.</p>

<p>Emotional subject, ALWAYS WEAK IN LEGS;
shell explosion; wound of back: PARAPARESIS.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 288.</b> (<span class="smcap">Dejerine</span>, February, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A Lieutenant, 25, was wounded at Arras about 10 a.m.
October 20, 1914, just as he was leaning on another officer’s
shoulder looking at a card in a chateau room. A shell burst
in the court yard. A fragment came in the window, struck
him in the back and pushed him forward, whereupon he felt
pain in the back and a severe dyspnea, due to the gas from
the shell. He lost consciousness several times and the
dyspnea lasted for about two hours. When he was picked
up he could not walk.</p>

<p>He was carried on a stretcher to the ambulance at Avin-le-Compte.
During the fortnight there, he was also several
times dyspneic. Strength left his legs and he could only get
about on crutches. There was now a suppurating wound in
the interscapular region where he had been struck by the
shell fragment. Evacuated to Paris, he was operated upon
on account of a tremendous abscess in the back, and the
shell fragment and some bits of cloth were removed. The
wound healed; but vague pains in the left thorax remained,
especially when the man walked.</p>

<p>On examination, July 28, 1915, he would in the standing
position hold his legs together with the feet resting on
their external borders, especially on the left side. The toes
were in plantar flexion, and the soles were arched upward
more on the left side than on the right. In walking, the legs
were always held in extension, the feet twisting outward.
If an attempt was made to walk quickly, the man walked
more and more upon the external borders of his feet, in such
wise that the plantar surface and the heel turned up and
became visible from above. He would get tired after five
minutes’ walking even if he spread his legs out for a broader
base of action. He could lift his legs only about 10 cm. from
the bed, but could flex and slowly extend his lower leg on the
thigh. He could not adduct or abduct the feet. Movements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
of extension and flexion of leg on thigh were jerky and
abruptly terminated, as also movements of thigh on hip.
The patient could not sit, and when leaning forward he could
not straighten up against resistance. The reflexes were normal.
There was no sensory disorder. The electric reactions
were normal. Pupils normal. There was slight hypertension
of the spinal fluid and a slight excess of albumin. There
were no lymphocytes.</p>

<p>In accordance with Dejerine’s idea that these neuropaths
always have antecedents looking in the same direction, it
was found that he had always been an emotional person,
easily affected, sympathetic with other people’s troubles,
given to weeping. As Lieutenant, he had not had the courage
to harangue his soldiers. He had often during his life
felt his legs weaken during times of emotion and had sometimes
been unable to walk, though nothing of the sort had
happened during the campaign. He was sure he could get
well, and wanted two months’ leave in order to get back to
the front. There were no hereditary features in the case.
A physician had told him that he had had meningitis. This
possibly followed whooping cough. He had had orchitis
after mumps at 16. He had not had children, nor had there
been miscarriages since marriage at 21.</p>

</div>

<h4><b>Case 289.</b> (<span class="smcap">Dejerine</span>, February, 1915.)</h4>

<p>An infantryman, 20, was sent as a Colonel’s bicyclist
about 1 p.m. September 30, 1914, with a message to one of
the battalions. He was exposed on the way to shell and
rifle fire, and was wounded by a bullet which entered 8 cm.
below and internal to the left mammillary line and came out
in the region of the left hypochondrium. He crawled to
some village houses 20 or 25 meters away. Another cyclist
came to transfer the order, but could not help him. A friend
came to his aid but was struck by a bullet 10 meters off and
remained on the ground for an hour while the young cyclist
lay behind a tree on the roadside. At 3 o’clock it was
possible to take him to a house around which shells were
raining. Shortly afterward the house caught fire. The man
was evacuated 6 kilometers to an ambulance in the night,
and that night six of his wounded comrades died in the same
room. The man had lost much blood and began to think
that his heart had been hit. He choked, had violent palpitations,
and intense thirst. By automobile next day he was
taken to the railway station at Maison and was there for a
day practically without food.</p>

<p>That evening, 36 hours after the wound, he was evacuated
to Juivisez and stayed there one night in the temporary hospital.
The hemorrhage had now practically ceased. When
he arrived next morning at Vincennes he could hardly move,
was unable to walk, had violent palpitation, precordial pain,
and two nervous seizures, with outcries and weeping. Several
days later he could not walk at all or raise himself in bed.
He was operated on May 29; he afterward felt the same leg
weakness and was still unable to walk. Early in December,
when observed by Dejerine, he was able to stand on crutches
with legs flexed, toes on the ground, and heels up. In walking
he would scrape the ground with the dorsum of the foot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
The wound was now healed. Suppuration had been intense
and the scars were extensive. Lying down, the man could
move, though slowly, his lower extremities in every way,
nor was there any diminution in the strength of his flexors
and extensors. The patient in making movements against
resistance would let go quickly and jerkily. The plantar
reflexes were flexor but weak. There was no other reflex
disorder, no evidence of sensory disorder, nor any sign of
neuritis or arthritis. Lumbar puncture gave a normal fluid
without tension.</p>

<p>There were no hereditary features in the case. The man
had been in childhood nervous and irascible, rolling on the
ground, crying and weeping when crossed. He had had
three attacks of appendicitis&mdash;one at 15 years and two at
19 years. After each attack he had felt weakness in the legs.
He remembered, too, that after his nervous crises on being
crossed, he had always felt this same weakness.</p>

<p>According to Dejerine, these paraplegic neuropaths, like
functional gastropaths, cardiopaths, and victims of urinary
disorder, have had earlier spells of the same kind, though
milder than the attack which brings them to medical notice.</p>

<p>A substitute officer (mother nervous; always slightly excitable,
easily fatiguable; had had a habit of wrinkling his
forehead) sustained wounds September 8, 1914, in the foot
and thigh. The wounds healed well, but in the hospital
he slept badly and had battle dreams. When he essayed to
walk, he had contractions of face muscles. There was a
lively tic involving both face and neck muscles, with the
head pulled to one side and backward. This grimacing
was but slightly influencible by the will. There was a
marked tremor of the arms. Gait was <i>trippelnd</i>. There
were tremors of the whole body. There was also a slight
hemi-hyperesthesia. The tendon reflexes were very lively;
vasomotor disorders (feelings of cold and perspiration).</p>

<p>Seven months later the phenomena had all disappeared

<h4><b>Case 291.</b> (<span class="smcap">Roussy and Lhermitte</span>, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A sergeant in a regiment of cuirassiers was observed at
Villejuif, January 25, 1915. He had lost power on the left
side as a result of fatigue and emotion, November, 1914. He
had a complete paralysis of the left arm and a paresis of the
left leg. There was an anesthesia of hysterical type in the
left arm, and also of the left leg as far as the middle of the
thigh. He dragged his leg in walking (<i>démarche en draguant</i>:
the toe is dragged along the ground, the trunk is bent forward,
and at every step plunges somewhat toward the paralyzed
side. The patient is able to walk, however, by means
of a cane or crutches. This walk is characteristic of hysterical
hemiplegia. According to Roussy and Lhermitte,
the number of cases of hysterical hemiplegia (better, hemiparesis)
is not large). The plantar reflexes on both sides
were those of flexion. Upon treatment (not specified), at
the end of six months he went back to service in the cavalry.</p>

<p>The point of note in this case is that this patient had had a
precisely similar phenomenon on the same side, which lasted
a month, at the age of sixteen years and a half. It is noteworthy
that in this case there was no traumatism and only
the factors of fatigue and emotion to serve as an occasion for
the hemiplegia. In fact, hysterical hemiplegia is said very
rarely to follow physical trauma to an extremity. There are,
however, some cases in which hemiparesis follows a slight
head wound, particularly if over the region controlling the
paralyzed limbs.</p>

<p>During the six-months’ course of successful treatment, no
atrophy of limbs appeared, and there was never any inequality
of the reflexes.</p>

</div>

<h4><b>Case 292.</b> (<span class="smcap">Duprés and Rist</span>, November, 1914.)</h4>

<p>A cuirassier, 24, one month in the field, began to feel in
September, 1914, crawling sensations in left arm and leg;
then fingers, later hand and forearm, and finally upper arm
began to work awkwardly and feel heavy, and there was a
little of the same sort of thing in the leg. Hand and forearm
were by the middle of October completely paralyzed, whereas
the arm and shoulder were only paretic. Anesthesia at this
time reached the elbow. The man had to be evacuated,
after two months’ active and skilful field service, in one
instance (September 19) carrying out a clever and useful
interception of hostile telephone messages.</p>

<p>It seems that at the age of 17 also the man had had a left-sided
hemiplegia, with sensory and motor symptoms, lasting
two months, cured by electricity applied with a small
electrode in his village. The war situation was therefore
actually a recurrence of the transient hysterical paraplegia.</p>

<p>Moreover, the patient’s father, 52, an old tabetic, had also
several times shown a hemiplegia (however on the right
side), a phenomenon which had strongly affected his son.</p>

<p>It was curious that the slight residuals of movement which
the cuirassier could perform could be made only while he was
looking at the parts he was requested to move, and were
impossible with eyes closed. The anesthesia was a total one
when observed in November, 1914, coming to a sharp and
circular termination at the shoulder and garter-wise above
the knee&mdash;tuning fork insensibility in the same areas. The
left patellar reflex was diminished when the eyes of the
patient were leveled at the knee; but a surprise test brought
the knee-jerk out normally. The hand and fingers were a
little darker in color, and the whole left arm a little colder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
than the right. There was also a slight amblyopia on the
left side.</p>

<p>This hysterical paraplegia proved rather resistant to
psychotherapy. The patient seems to have systematically
eliminated from consciousness and from action the entire
function of the left arm and a good deal of the left leg. Duprés
and Rist speak of this as a kind of functional excommunication
of the parts.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> relapses, Wiltshire remarks that the frequency of relapses
and the ways in which they are produced favor the
conception that the original cause of Shell-shock must be
psychic. Sir George Savage remarks that cases of Shell-shock
should not return to the service under a period of six
months on account of the frequency of relapse. Others have
recently argued that such cases should not be sent back to
the front at all. Harris notes that relapse may follow so
apparently slight a factor as a vivid dream. Remarks concerning
the true nature of relapses are made by Russell.
Russell, for example, disapproves anesthetics in curing such
a hysterical phenomenon as deafmutism. This sort of treatment
does not get at the real cause of the condition, so that
the man is very liable to relapse with the same symptoms.
Ballet and de Fursac note the many cases of relapse after
treatment and after discharge. Sometimes the relapses were
due to some unfortunate happening, but in other instances
no external cause could be made out. Fear of having to
return to the front is a factor in certain cases, so that the
true answer to the relapse question may not come until
after the war.</p>

<p>Roussy and Boisseau insist upon the value of rapid cures
(psychotherapy, electricity, cold shower, etc.), in diminishing
the number of relapses. They maintain that these rapid cures
abolish any chance for the man to brood over symptoms and
thus to exaggerate and fixate them. These workers send
their hospital return back to the regiments with a statement
relative to diagnosis and the request that he be immediately
returned to hospital if neurotic symptoms appear.</p>

<h4><b>Case 293.</b> (<span class="smcap">MacCurdy</span>, July, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A private 20 (always rather tenderhearted, disliking to see
animals killed; rather self-conscious; a bit seclusive; “rather
more virtuous than his companions”; shy with girls; sore
throat a year or more before the war, with inability to sing
or talk; always a lisper) enlisted in May, 1916, spent five
advantageous months in training and became increasingly
sociable. However, on going to the front October, 1916, he
was frightened by the first shell fire and horrorstricken by
the sight of wounds and death. He grew accustomed to the
horrors and five months later was sent to Armentières, where
he had to fight for three days without sleep. He grew very
tired and began to hope that he would receive wounds that
might incapacitate him at least temporarily for service.</p>

<p>He was suddenly buried by a shell, did not lose consciousness,
but on being dug out was found to be deaf and
dumb. On the way to the field dressing station he had a fear
of shells. The deafmutism persisted unchanged for a month
and then was completely and permanently cured in less than
five minutes. He was made to face a mirror and observe
the start he gave when hands were clapped behind him. He
was assured that this start was an evidence of hearing; that
his hearing was not lost, nor was his speech. He had no
relapses during two months.</p>

<p>According to MacCurdy, this case is a typical one of war
neurosis of the type of a simple conversion hysteria. The
man never suffered from anxiety or nightmares.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> burial cases, Grasset suggests that some of the patients
probably think that they have actually died; both sensation
and motion have been lost, and it is naturally these that
permit a man to believe that he is still alive. The classical
case is recalled, of the almost absolutely anesthetic boy who,
with eyes closed, at once fell asleep. Foucault’s patient also
said he actually thought he was dead after an explosion.</p>

</div>

<h4><b>Case 294.</b> (<span class="smcap">Zanger</span>, July, 1915.)</h4>

<p>Several years before the war, a cavalry officer had a severe
concussion of the brain after a fall from his horse, but got no
manifest symptoms therefrom except a mild transient deafness.
There must have been a vestibular nerve injury, however,
since there was a marked bilateral subexcitability of
this apparatus later determined.</p>

<p>In September, 1914, as the result of strains and privation
in the field, he got vertigo and lachrymose spells, with some
obsessions as though he would have to shoot himself in the
foot or spring out at the enemy from the trench.</p>

<p>In hospital at Jena, insomnia, anxiety, excessive perspiration
and salivation, feelings of the death of various parts of
the body, especially the forearms and hands, associated with
hypesthesia of the parts, were determined. He had a feeling
of vertigo on walking and was very sensitive to noise.
He now developed a very intense and very variable degree of
deafness on both sides, diagnosticated as nervous deafness.
The caloric test demonstrated vestibular subexcitability
above mentioned. We may suppose that in this already
injured organism fresh disorder had set in on a psychogenic
basis in the same region that had been injured years before.</p>

<p>June 7, a mine exploded in his vicinity, smashing several
of his comrades. He did not himself fall to the ground, but
was overwhelmed by a violent feeling of anguish. After a
while, he lost consciousness. He woke up at Bologna, June
15, as after a long sleep. During the interval he had been
in a state of intense hallucinatory delirium day and night.
Then his mind began gradually to clear, first with amnesia
of the shock which had caused the trauma. Then he recalled
this fact too. Dizziness, however, grew in intensity so that
he fell to ground many times during the day. There were
intermittent tremors in the limbs.</p>

opened the loop-hole, braced the rifle, and found he could not

days he had been blind, although once he could see his parents,
who visited him in hospital, almost clearly. His appearance
under examination strongly recalled that of a blind man. He
was induced to read some large print, then smaller print, and

As a result, he later suffered from tonic muscular spasms
whenever he had to exert himself seriously, especially whenever
he had to move his legs and when sudden movements or

as one of the Wernicke <i>Crampusneurosen</i>, a disease somewhat
related with hysteria.</p>

had, however, frequently had cramps in his legs.</p>

<p>ANTEBELLUM spasm of hands, functional.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 299.</b> (<span class="smcap">Hewat</span>, March, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A boy, 19, had been passed as fit for laboring work at home.
He had been a farm boy from 14. Once at 17 he had developed
whilst working amongst turnips in wet weather,
pain in the hands, which got worse and was followed by pains
in legs, arm, and neck, that kept him in bed a week, and from
work ten days. Even on returning to work, his hands were
swollen, though he was able to drive a horse. The fingers
had been somewhat firmly flexed on the palms ever since this
illness at 17.</p>

<p>He was sent to Netley after three weeks of army work, as
having a spasm of both hands. He was found to be mentally
below par, nervous, apprehensive, stuttering in speech and not
readily responsive, with defective vasomotor control, though
of good average bodily development except for asymmetry
of chest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span></p>

<p>Both hands were found firmly closed; tips of fingers applied
to palms; thumbs freely movable; forearms well developed,
especially the flexors. Counterforce was exerted
upon passive extension of fingers. There was no sensory or
reflex disorder, and while the patient was asleep, it was found
that the first and second fingers of both hands could be fully
extended. Yet there was a definite contracture of the
palmar fascia which prevented full extension of the third and
fourth fingers. He was awakened by this test and the fingers
became firmly flexed at once.</p>

<p>The man was treated by milk isolation behind screens,
without permission to read, smoke, or talk. Twice a day he
was encouraged to move the fingers and made to perform
finger exercises. He became able to extend the fingers over
half their normal excursion in three days, and was then able to
abduct and adduct the fingers. He was allowed up in two
weeks’ time, with full diet and screens removed. The contracture
of the palmar fascia was still in evidence, but the
power of movement in the hands and fingers was so satisfactory
that he could be sent back to duty in three weeks. The
interpretation of Fergus Hewat is that the painful condition
of the hands which set in in the illness at the age of 17, had
caused an obsession which had developed into a functional
spasm of the hands.</p>

<p>A nineteen year old soldier, for some months a bit distressed
and irritable, had a dispute with an old man whose
jug he unluckily happened to smash. The old man said
something was going to happen to him for that. That day,
in point of fact, he fell and sustained an injury with water
on the right knee. He was upbraided by the captain and
evacuated to the ambulance. The fellow thought the old
man with the broken jug had interfered, dreamed of the old
man’s threats, and felt his hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>Next day hemichorea developed on the right side, a partial
and rhythmic chorea with jerky, regular contractions, fifty
to sixty per minute, affecting synchronously the muscles of the
leg, arm, face and tongue.</p>

<p>Dupuoy speaks of the reason for the hysterical “choice”
of this disease, since his mother had had a probably organic
hemichorea, also on the right side, with which she died at
thirty years in a stroke. The boy was at that time thirteen
years old and had had a rhythmic chorea six weeks, limited to
the extensors of the hand on the forearm, treated in hospital.</p>

<h4><b>Case 301.</b> (<span class="smcap">Rows</span>, March, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A private, 31,&mdash;a case of Capt. W. Brown,&mdash;was admitted
to hospital suffering from hallucinations of hearing
and delusions of supervision by his family and friends; he
heard his relatives telling him what to do and what not to do.
He thought they belonged to a secret police entrusted with
the task of supervising his actions and seeing that he did not
again transgress as he had done. An inquiry into his past
revealed the following facts:</p>

<p>He had been a bank clerk before the war and once because of
a nervous breakdown as a result of drinking and smoking
had been given a three months’ vacation. On this occasion
he went with a prostitute&mdash;his first and only offence in sex
matters. He later thought the behavior of his family indicated
that they knew of his misdeed. He heard the voices
of members of his family, became rapidly worse and more
depressed, and attempted suicide.</p>

<p>He went to a private asylum. Later, he emigrated to
Canada, but he was still pursued by the voices and he returned
to England. He enlisted at the outbreak of the war and
went to France. He was soon invalided and sent to Maghull.</p>

<p>The cause of his condition, according to Rows, was his
affair with the prostitute and his previous drinking. This
was explained to him as the basis of his strong feeling of
self-reproach. The hallucinations and idea of suicide had
developed therefrom. Recovery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span> “to a large extent.”</p>

</div>

<h4><b>Case 302.</b> (<span class="smcap">Rogues de Fursac</span>, July, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A man, 36 (boat painter to 30 and thereafter a wine seller;
paternal grandmother insane, father alcoholic and suicide;
gonorrhea, 20; two attacks of lead colic, 25 to 30; purulent
pleurisy, 31; phlegmon of mouth, 34; also a chronic alcoholic),
at the time of examination showed arteriosclerosis
and slightly hypertrophic liver; unequal pupils, slightly contracted
and sluggish to light. He complained of frequent
headaches, possibly due to a combination of plumbism and
alcoholism. He was not in any respect demented, and had
an excellent memory. He had always been emotional, being
unable to go to a funeral without many tears, or remain in a
house where there was a corpse without threatening to faint.
He was always overcome if he saw a fight going on; and even
in his wine shop he would escape when there was a fight and
get a neighbor to bring the police.</p>

<p>He was mobilized on the fifth day, sent first to a territorial
regiment and then, in October, put into the reserve of an
active regiment and sent to the front. He reached the first
line trenches in the night, greatly affected by ruins he saw on
the road. He slept poorly and had nightmares. At daybreak
he woke up to see a pile of corpses near by, and felt an
indescribable terror on account of the corpses and the noise
of bullets, machine guns, and shells. By superhuman efforts&mdash;according
to the man&mdash;he mastered his emotions and
took his turn at the observation post. Another sleepless
night. Next day he got such tremors that his sergeant sent
him to the hospital where he was at first thought to be suffering
from a fever. But his temperature was found normal,
and he was sent back to the trenches.</p>

<p>He passed another night without sleep, and next day he
could not hold his gun for trembling. The Captain sent him
back to be a kitchen man in the rear, and here he remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
six weeks&mdash;restless, trembling, eating very little. He would
have anxious spells. In the morning, as he was carrying
coffee to the men in his company, on seeing a pile of corpses,
he dropped his pot and ran back to the kitchen declaring that
<i>whoever wanted to carry coffee might</i>, but he would not go
back. He spilled a pot of soup on his left foot. The Captain
had him evacuated, saying: “Go! when you come back, I
hope the war will be over!”</p>

<p>He was sent back to a hospital near Paris, where he was all
right for a few days, happy as a prince. The burn got well,
and as the time approached when he would probably have to
go back to the front, the terror returned. He had visions of
corpses, and imagined bullets whistling, machine guns popping,
and shells bursting. He wept, lost appetite, hid in
corners, made three suicidal attempts by poisoning,&mdash;though
the sincerity of these attempts was doubtful (zinc oxide ointment;
rose laurel leaves; verdigris). Sent back to a dépôt
before getting leave, he had crises of tremor with anxiety,
and was then sent to Val-de-Grâce on the mental service, and
finally to Ville-Évrard. He unhesitatingly confessed his
terror, becoming more and more anxious and tremulous, and
almost <i>losing his pulse</i> while describing his experiences. He
said he would commit suicide rather than return to the front.
He stayed at the Hospital, working in the garden rather
calmly, but when it was a question of leaving, even on convalescence,
his terror and anxiety returned. Every time he
was examined there was an emotional explosion, with expressions
of anguish, generalized tremors and crises of clonic convulsions
with respiratory disturbance even of threatening
suffocation, depression of pulse. It is this latter which is the
most important element in the proof that such a case is not a
case of simulation.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> war cases, Bennati remarks upon the great number
that do not fall into known categories. There is, he thinks,
an anaphylactic group in which the trauma acts as the
secondary toxic agent; and there is another group in which
exhaustion works after the manner suggested by Edinger:
that is, by a physiological overwork of certain structures.</p>

to him. He did not at all enjoy leaves at night, as he
stumbled and fell about in the darkness and had shells burst
near by. He lived immersed in mud. He reacted unfavorably
to antityphoid injection.</p>

but then suddenly relapsed into depression, emotionality,

19, 1915. He became unconscious and later suffered from
nervousness and stuttering, depression, insomnia, frightful

that he was again returned to the front. A shell
burst near him once more and again he grew dazed, trembled,
had lapses of memory and fell into a state of general nervousness.
He improved again in hospital.</p>

<p>On returning to the front in a few days he saw a bomb
burst some distance away. He began to stammer and to
wander about aimlessly. Insomnia, tremor of legs, arms
and head, fatiguability, feeling of lassitude, occipital and
vertical headache, fear of aircraft and crowds, frightful
dreams, absences and aimless wanderings appeared. There
was one attack of deafmutism. Whenever the patient saw
aircraft he ran. He was easily startled by noises.</p>

<p>He was the son of an excitable, alcoholic father and of a
nervous and bad tempered mother. A sister had had nervous
prostration. The man himself had always been more
or less moody and a nail-biter. According to Wolfsohn, 74
per cent of the war neuroses have a family history of neurotic
or psychotic stigmata, including insanity, epilepsy, alcoholism
and nervousness; 72 per cent show previous neuropathy.</p>

<p>According to Wolfsohn, wounded soldiers do not show war
neuroses except in rare instances. In the wounded soldiers
studied by him no neuropathic or psychopathic stigmata
occurred in the family history and previous neuropathic tendencies
in the patients themselves were found in about 10%.</p>

<p>A perfect soldier type. Mine explosion; burial;

</div>

<h4><b>Case 307.</b> (<span class="smcap">MacCurdy</span>, July, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A lieutenant, 29, had been a regular soldier for eight years
before the war and was made a non-commissioned officer
almost at once after enlisting. He went out as a sergeant
with the original expeditionary force and got through the
retreat from Mons and the first battle of Ypres intact. He
enjoyed the fighting hugely and even got indifferent to the
burial work. The death of chums saddened him, but he
carried on and soon forgot about the incidents. He might
be regarded as a perfect soldier.</p>

<p>In August, 1915, there was a slight touch of rheumatism.
Two or three months later the Germans exploded a mine
immediately in front of the trench where he was. He went
pale for the first time in his life, but kept his men “standing
to.” Thereafter he began to think for the first time about
danger. Mining was hereabouts the chief form of attack,
and he frequently heard Germans digging beneath a dug-out.
He slept well in billets, but was too restless for sleep on
active duty.</p>

<p>He got more and more on edge during the next weeks. Six
weeks after the mine explosion he was buried in a dug-out.
Though he did not lose consciousness, he was dazed and had
to lie down for two hours. Nervousness, chronic headache
and insomnia, even in billets, followed. His imagination
played upon the blowing out of dug-outs and the bowling
over of men by shells. He had become company sergeant-major
and the responsibility made him grow worse and worse.
At times he tended to jump when the shells came, but was
outwardly perfectly calm. He began to take morphia,
though with little result. He had suicidal thoughts.</p>

<p>After two months of these symptoms he was sent to
England. He began to sleep fairly well and three months
later applied for light duty; was greatly bored by the company
accountant work given him; got a commission and was sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
back to the front nine months later, January, 1917. He got
on with the active fighting very well, sleeping four or five
hours a night. In April he was sent to Arras. He had had
a dream that he was going to be bowled over, buried and
wounded in the neck. Sleep got poorer. In April he led his
men in an advance and actually was bowled over, buried and
hit in the neck as well as in the knee and the hand, though all
the wounds were superficial. He was carried back, dazed,
to hospital, where he grew fairly comfortable in ten days and
even undertook a journey down to the base.</p>

<p>He arrived in collapse, remained in camp at the base three
weeks, getting steadily worse. Something, he could not tell
what, was going to happen and kill him. He could not concentrate,
even to read. He thought of suicide. He slept
practically not at all, waking from a doze with a start, feeling
that something had hit him. He had dreams of being taken
prisoner and on waking would in fancy start a fight to escape
from imagined imprisonment back to the British lines. After
two weeks in various hospitals he spent ten days in a hospital
for nervous cases and grew better. Riding on trains he was
terrorized in every tunnel lest he should be crushed.</p>

<p>According to MacCurdy, an anxiety neurosis would have
developed had not his superiors sent the lieutenant back to
hospital after the final burial in April. As this perfect soldier

<p>Shell-shock; thrown against a wall: Tremors&mdash;TREMOPHOBIA.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 308.</b> (<span class="smcap">Meige</span>, February, 1916.)</h4>

<p>Meige has studied shell-shock tremors, especially those
occurring without external wound.</p>

<p>A corporal was with his squad on the Nouvron Plateau,
January 13, 1915, when he was thrown against the wall by a
bursting shell, which killed or wounded several comrades
but did not wound the corporal. Whether he lost consciousness
is unknown, but he lay on the ground for some time,
until he could be moved through a communication trench.
After the explosion he began to tremble, and was still trembling
on his trip back. Constantly trembling, he lived on at
the front for a fortnight, but without eating; and, although
he had been a good rifleman, he had lost all his former skill
with a gun.</p>

<p>There was a delay of a month before evacuation, but the
trembling did not cease, and he was passed through various
units, to the neurological center at Villers-Cotterets, where
he remained for two months,&mdash;April 13 to June 15, 1915,&mdash;with
a diagnosis of hysterical chorea. He was examined by
Guillain, who found, besides the generalized tremors, lively
knee-jerks and Achilles jerks, an excessive emotionality, particularly
marked when the guns were going or bombs bursting.
Lumbar puncture yielded a perfectly normal fluid.</p>

<p>June 19 the corporal went to the Salpêtrière under P.
Marie. July 14 he was evacuated to the civil hospital of
Arcueil, where he remained till September 24, when he was
sent home to convalesce, from October 26 to December 15.</p>

<p>He returned to the Salpêtrière December 15, 1915.
Throughout these various movements from hospital to hospital,
his status was unchanged. At the time of report about
a year after shell-shock, he was still constantly and uniformly
trembling. All four limbs were affected, perhaps the right
arm and the left leg more markedly. There was no tremor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
during sleep, but there was a tremor when the patient lay
awake in dorsal decubitus just as when he was sitting or
standing. The tremor was worse in the evening than in the
morning, and the patient could get to sleep only very late.
There was slight tremor of the head; the eyelids and the tongue
showed a few tremors, which were not synchronous with
those of the limbs. Nystagmus was absent. To diminish
the effect of the trembling, the patient held his forearms
flexed and kept his elbows close to his body. If the trembling
of the legs got intense, the patient would rise and walk
a few steps. Any movement, such as carrying a spoon or a
glass to the mouth, led to an exaggeration of the tremors;
and there was at this time a suggestion of the intention
tremor of multiple sclerosis. The tremor was increased when
the eyes were closed. Any sudden noise or sharp command,
or recalling to mind of trench service, would bring about
extraordinary motor crises, in which there was an intense
and generalized tremor, so the patient would lose his balance.
Any attempt at eliciting reflexes would produce generalized
violent tremor. Sensations were normal; tendency to hyperidrosis;
pulse in repose, 60, rising to 120 if one struck the
table sharply.</p>

<p>Meige remarks that a number of examples of tremors
suggestive of Parkinson’s disease were observed in the War
of 1870. Might the explosion have caused properly situated
lesions in the encephalon of such a nature as to produce a
Parkinsonian tremor? The tremors were stationary, and
if due to some lesion, the lesion remains now exactly what
it was at the beginning. There was no digital tremor such
as is characteristic of Parkinson’s disease. Moreover, the
intention tremor of such a patient, rather than Parkinson’s
disease, suggests multiple sclerosis, of which latter disease,
however, there is no other sign. Nor does there seem any
evidence that these tremors were of cerebellar, paretic, goitrous,
or of any definite toxic origin. On the whole, Meige
regards it as a neuropathic manifestation resembling what is
found in traumatic neurosis. He believes that there is not
sufficient evidence that it is the consequence of any structural
change in the nervous system.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span></p>

<p>Meige remarks that the analysis of any case of tremor
must take the mental state into account. This patient,
perfectly conscious of his tremors and their critical exacerbations,
was much chagrined thereby. He suffered mentally
from his impotence, especially when bystanders would intentionally
bring about his paroxysms. He looked like one
shuddering from fear, and it is actually probable that he was
afraid of his own tremors and shuddering. He was, besides
subject to tremor, also a victim of tremophobia,&mdash;a kind of
phobia described some years since by Meige, somewhat resembling
ereutophobia, or fear of blushing, described by
Pitres and Régis.</p>

<p>Four hours in a freezing bog: Hysterical glossolabial
hemispasm twelve hours after rescue. No
sensory disorder of face or tongue; sensory disorder
of arm, but no motor disorder.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 309.</b> (<span class="smcap">Binswanger</span>, July, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A man, 27, in good health, called on the second day of the
mobilization, got into the line two weeks from mobilization,
first in the West, and then, from mid-September, in the East.
He was in the artillery and stood shell fire in a big battle
very well.</p>

<p>However, December 27, 1914, while engaged in transport
service, on the way back with his horse, he fell into a bog
and gradually sank to his neck. Attempts to get the man and
his horse out failed. All that saved him from drowning was
the freezing of the bog surface. After four hours he was
freed by his comrades, apparently frozen stiff, but with consciousness
completely preserved. On the next day, at about
five o’clock,&mdash;twelve hours after his release from the frozen
bog,&mdash;he had a seizure. It began with headache on the
left side and loss of consciousness that lasted 24 hours. The
right leg was paralyzed and very painful. He passed
through various hospitals and finally arrived at the Jena
Nerve Hospital, January 25, 1915.</p>

<p>He was a tall, powerful man, with a slow regular pulse,
accelerated heart sounds, lively dermatographia, increased
muscular excitability, general increase of knee and Achilles
reflexes (left greater than right), slight patellar and ankle
clonus present on the left side, Babinski reaction absent,
plantar reflex more lively on the left than on the right, but
abdominal reflex more lively right than left. Head painful
to percussion in the left temporal region. Touch and pain
sense segmentally absent in both right extremities. Arm
movements free; tremors absent. Active movements almost
impossible in the right leg; on passive movement marked
pain. Slight muscular tension about knee-, hip-, and ankle-joints.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
The patient got about with a cane, trailing the left
leg. Romberg sign.</p>

<p>The right angle of the mouth was withdrawn slightly
upward and outward, and lagged a little in active movements.
The protruded tongue deviated completely into the
right angle of the mouth and there remained, but without
tremor. The uvula deviated to the right, and the right
palate was held higher than the left. Lively palatal reflex.
Speech intact. The patient’s chief complaint was attacks
of coughing, which increased his headache to the point of intolerability.
A harmless drug caused the coughing and
headache to disappear. The patient was a quiet, willing
man, who industriously went through his exercises, and on
the Kaiser’s birthday was already walking in the marketplace.
His tongue contractions gradually improved. His
body-weight increased.</p>

<p>In the course of two months the glossolabial and palatal
contractions had largely disappeared. The walking movements
of the right leg had improved, although there was still
a distinct paresis, and a stiffness in the right knee and ankle
joints. Climbing stairs was impossible on account of difficulty
at the hip. March 30, 1915, the sensory improvement
was marked. There was a feeling as though the last three
fingers of the hand were asleep; walking was improved; he
could walk one or two hours a day. The walk was still
slightly spastic-paretic, May 28, when he was discharged.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that the hysterical attack had such a long
incubation period in this case: twelve hours after his removal
from the marsh. There were doubtless physical factors
of refrigeration, on the one hand, and on the other, psychic
factors of fear of sinking alive in the marsh, at the bottom of
the phenomenon. The most marked feature, of course, was
the glossolabial hemispasm. In the presence of this hemispasm,
it is remarkable that there should have been no
anesthesia or analgesia of the face, cheek, or tongue; and
moreover the paresis of the right mouth and tongue was far
less marked than the contracture. It is also striking that
the right upper extremity, although it had sensory disorder,
failed to show motor disorder.</p>

<h4><b>Case 310.</b> (<span class="smcap">Loewy</span>, April, 1915.)</h4>

<p>An infantryman was standing below an embankment when
a horse fell upon him, bruising him slightly on the left hip.
This infantryman later continually complained of pains in
the opposite hip though there had never been a contusion
there, nor anything felt there. These complaints could not
be influenced by exhortation, by diversion, or by drugs. If
they were purposely ignored, the patient reacted complainingly
and in a way to suggest delusions of persecution.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, this querulous man soon proved an effective
soldier in a storming attack in which the whole battalion
distinguished itself, putting himself forward particularly. In
fact, by himself he captured a whole group of Russians!</p>

<p>Thereupon all the pains in the hip ceased, nor did they
recur so long as he was under observation. Morose and
complaining before, he now became cheerful.</p>

<h4><b>Case 311.</b> (<span class="smcap">Oppenheim</span>, July, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A cuirassier was kicked by a horse on left side of abdomen,
November 24, and lost consciousness. A month later, in
hospital, hardness and tenderness to pressure of abdominal
wall, <i>spastic muscles</i> everywhere, pseudospastic tremor of
legs, and complaints of double vision were noted. He also
had attacks of convulsions, in which he became unconscious,
twitchings appeared, but the tongue was not bitten. Urine
was often involuntarily passed in these attacks, but he was
not always continent outside attacks, as, for instance, in
coughing.</p>

<p>On admission to nerve hospital: Right-sided monocular
diplopia; mild ptosis; ocular movements free. Rapid tremor
on shaking hands. Stood with straddling legs affected by
vibrating tremor. Knee-jerks considerably increased. In
the dorsal position movements of the left leg were accompanied
by marked tremor. He even could not go to sleep
easily on account of twitching of the left leg.</p>

<p>His comrades observed that he had convulsions at night,
and often spoke in his sleep. Inoculation against typhoid
fever was made early in December. Later, permanent rise
of temperature to 37.8. Several attacks, lasting about ten
minutes, came under observation of the physician.</p>

<p>In January, progressive improvement in the motor sphere
and also psychically. The urinary disturbance likewise disappeared,
but the spasms persisted.</p>

<p>Windage from a shell; fear; fall, unconscious:
Homonymous hemianopsia (organic? functional?)
with blinking and vasomotor excitability.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 312.</b> (<span class="smcap">Steiner</span>, October, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A volunteer, 19 (never ill; no nervous disease in the
family) after a period of training went into the field October
3, 1914. November 5 a shell struck near his trench, but
failed to explode. Up to that time everything had been
quiet. The soldier had been looking out of the loop-hole,
surveying the landscape. He felt a great fear, felt a blow in
the neck, and fell down unconscious. How long he was unconscious
is unknown. Sometime later he walked back with
his comrades.</p>

<p>About an hour later, this volunteer&mdash;who was a very
intelligent young man, possessing some knowledge of biology,
including the nature of visual fields&mdash;noticed a black spot
in the field of vision, which came and went, but after a few
hours remained continually without disappearing. Otherwise
there was no complaint except a feeling of dizziness
when stooping.</p>

<p>Upon examination there could be found no disorder of the
internal organs. Neurologically there was blinking, vasomotor
excitability, slight reddening of the face, and dermatographia.
An expert in ophthalmology confirmed the existence
of a homonymous defect in the fields of vision. This
defect could not be influenced by suggestion or by any other
treatment, nor did any other change whatever occur in the
condition.</p>

<p>Steiner inquires whether this hemianopsia is to be taken
as organic or functional. The air-pressure of the shell hissing
past might have produced a concussion, or the falling unconscious
might have produced a <i>commotio cerebri</i> or a slight
hemorrhage. The tic-like blinking and vasomotor excitability,
however, suggest functionality.</p>

<p>Shell-shock PSORIASIS. Post-traumatic eczema.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 313.</b> (<span class="smcap">Gaucher and Klein</span>, May, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A soldier, 28, came to the Saint-Louis skin clinic, May 15,
1916, for leg lesions three months old. These lesions were
cicatricial, squamous, irregular-contoured, and had developed
following a wound. The lesions were eczematous.</p>

<p>On the trunk, arms and elbow were lesions of psoriasis.
These lesions had appeared after shell-shock. The man
had been bowled over June 16, 1915, by a <i>marmite</i>. The
psoriatic lesions appeared shortly afterwards. The patient
had never seen anything of the sort before.</p>

<p>In this case the trauma provoked eczema; the emotion,
psoriasis. Gaucher and Klein say that they have been
struck by the recrudescence of psoriasis since the outbreak of
the war, and remark, also, that there has been a relative
increase of new cases since July, 1914.</p>

<p>There are cases of psoriasis following nervous shock,
emotion and trauma. Sometimes the psoriatic lesion develops
upon the scar of a wound. In the above case, as in
the case of a woman of 25, a refugee from the Arras bombardment,
the psoriasis began <i>de novo</i> and slowly developed
immediately after the catastrophe of the Jena. Five, possibly
six, out of eight cases totaled, appear, unlike the case
sketched above, to have developed in cases either tuberculous
or of tuberculous stock.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> psoriasis, Vignolo-Nutati remarks that this is a relatively
frequent skin disease amongst Italian soldiers. He
states that many of these cases are due to nervous shock.
Some are related to wounds appearing near the scars. In
all cases an emotional disturbance is the chief cause. Vignolo-Nutati
had 86 cases of psoriasis in six months, 52 of the
men coming from the front. Eighteen of the men said that
they had not previously suffered from the disease.</p>

<p>A sergeant gets the CROIX DE GUERRE and
SHELL-SHOCK together: Transient deafness;
later pseudohallucinatory electric bell ringing, reminiscent
of civilian work; stereotyped movements,
reminiscent of war experience.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 314.</b> (<span class="smcap">Laignel-Lavastine and Courbon</span>, May,
1916.)</h4>

<p>A sergeant, 24, had worked about Parisian hotels from the
age of thirteen and a half. He won the <i>croix de guerre</i> and
was evacuated for his wounds April 24, 1915.</p>

<p>It seems that he carried the remains of his company,
which had been decimated the night before by a mine explosion,
on to the enemy trench, getting there first and facing
three Germans, whom he beat down. At this time, gas
shells began to rain about. Making a number of violent
expiratory movements to get rid of the gas, he found himself
unable to progress on account of the fall of the shells,
and sat motionless with his hands before his face. He was
cast to the earth by an explosion, which at the same time
blew off a revolver which the wounded lieutenant had passed
to him. He sat up, and, observing that the soldiers had
gotten the trench, went back to the lines, where he told his
story.</p>

<p>He then found that he was deaf, and wounded in the left
leg. The wounds rapidly healed, but sundry other symptoms
developed. He had a peculiar sensation back of the forehead.
He could not think, read or write and was very weary. He
got better in a few months, but disorders kept returning.</p>

<p>His deafness had left him in about a fortnight, but when
his hearing came back spontaneously, there were peculiar
sensations. He constantly heard an electric bell, intense
and continuous, like that of a French cinema advertising its
films. The sounds seemed to begin in the ear and to run out
as a sort of whistling. This sensation was preceded by
buzzing and associated with noises like those of a musical
triangle or a steam whistle. The noise kept up during waking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
hours, but was often forgotten while he was at work. In
sleep he heard nothing, except sometimes battle noises.
August 20, 1915, he was given the diagnosis: labyrinthine
shock&mdash;hearing returned.</p>

<p>About ten weeks after evacuation, when the headaches
and thought blocking began to disappear, a generalized
tremor, especially of the head, set in, which the patient
called St. Vitus’ dance. Then a peculiar gait began, which
lasted several weeks and then transiently reappeared. Every
few steps his legs would bend, and he could only walk forward
in the attitude of a man who is concealing his height.
After resting a few minutes he began to walk regularly again
and the cycle began over again. He had to walk with two
canes. If he felt some sudden emotion, or sometimes without
any obvious reason, he would stop short and look straight
ahead, with body bent, and arms before his face. This
would last but a moment, whereupon he would walk again
normally.</p>

<p>When this anomalous walking disappeared, curious face
movements and gestures began. If a strange person arrived,
the forehead and eyebrows would contract, the eyelids would
stand wide, which gave him an expression of surprise lasting
a few seconds. At the same time the mouth would open and
remain so for some moments. A forced expiration would be
executed, suggesting a fish out of water. He would then
imperatively strike the table with his fist, or the ground with
his foot.</p>

<p>Laignel-Lavastine and Courbon explain the anomalous
movements as stereotypies due to secondary automatism.
They are not convulsive, are not preceded by emotion or
followed by a sense of relief, and are not tics. They are
gestures and postures without present significance, but
adapted to certain former circumstances. The electric bell
effect is a sort of pseudohallucination, differing from true
hallucinations in little except the absence of the externalizing
feature. The stereotypical movements are reproductions
of things done in the battle, and the pseudohallucinations
relate to the former hotel work of the soldier.</p>

<p>Cinema worker, two days after being waked up by
a shell, develops a nystagmiform tremor of eyes and
tachycardia. Graves’ disease? Tic (“occupational
virtuosity”)?</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 315.</b> (<span class="smcap">Tinel</span>, April, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A soldier was waked up with a start Sept. 22, 1914, by a
shell burst. The man was not wounded or shocked, and
merely felt a good deal moved. The next day but one he
felt a little movement of his eyes, which was at first intermittent
but in three or four days became continuous and
troublesome. These movements were those of nystagmus,
almost transverse and very rapid, and suggestive rather of a
vibratory trembling than of a true nystagmus of the eye or of
labyrinthine disease. When the patient fixed an object, the
nystagmus would stop for a few seconds and then immediately
reappear. There had never been any vertigo, nausea,
vomiting, deafness, ocular disorder, or disorder of equilibration.
During the tests for nystagmus, the morbid
nystagmus would stop and be replaced by the normal nystagmus
which was obviously slower and more regular. The
condition had persisted from September, 1914, to the meeting
of the Neurological Society, April 15, 1915. The patient
said he had become very emotional and got palpitations on
the slightest occasion, such as a fast walk, going upstairs, or
hearing a loud noise. There was also a slight vibratory
trembling of the fingers and a permanent tachycardia (120-140
beats). Tinel regards the case as one of neurosis, due to
a neuromuscular hyperexcitability comparable in some ways
with that found in Graves’ disease.</p>

<p>Meige, in discussion, called attention to the fact that not
every nystagmus is of organic origin and that there is a rare
form of tic of nystagmiform nature. The victim in this case
was an employee in a moving picture house, and very possibly
his occupation had permitted him to utilize what Meige
speaks of as a “occupational virtuosity” of the eye muscles.</p>

<p>Synesthesialgia: FOOT pain on rubbing dry
HANDS, following bullet wound of leg.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 316.</b> (<span class="smcap">Lortat-Jacob and Sézary</span>, November, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A foot chasseur was wounded, September 15, 1914, low in
the right thigh, a bullet entering outside the biceps tendon
and emerging on the inner aspect of the leg, 4 cm. below the
knee joint. He at once began to feel pains in the right foot,
which grew swollen and red. The leg began to flex upon the
thigh and, after straightening under anesthesia, was placed
in plaster. An arteriovenous aneurysm developed in the
popliteal space; operation, October 22nd, followed November
1, by ligature. The pains in the foot grew better after
this operation; but as soon as the wound was cicatrized they
came back again as before.</p>

<p>For seven months the foot pains remained sharp and continuous,
such that the man could not leave his bed. If a
bright light struck his eyes, the pains grew much more
marked, especially in the morning on awakening. The patient
found that when his <i>hands</i> were <i>dry</i> he could not use
them because of the violent <i>pains</i> which rubbing them would
cause in the <i>right foot</i>. Accordingly he kept putting his
hands to his mouth to moisten them. Finally he kept a
wet rag by him which he could pass from one hand to the
other.</p>

<p>The pain was what made walking difficult. Foot movements
were only a bit less ample on the affected side than
on the normal side. There was a general muscular atrophy
of the lower extremity (30.5: 34 about calf, and 40: 49
about thigh). Right knee-jerk more lively than left. Right
Achilles jerk absent. Negligible disorders of electrical excitability
in the territory of the right sciatic nerve. The
skin of the foot was a little thin and pale; the temperature
was low; and the nails had transverse striations. The
pains grew gradually a little less marked, but if the room
temperature was increased or lowered or if the foot became
cold, the pains became extreme. Pressure on the popliteal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
space produced pain on the external border of the foot; likewise
pressure on the calf. Lasègue’s sign could not be tested
for on account of the contracture of the flexors of leg on
thigh. Due to the direct action of the bullet, there was an
objective hyperesthesia of the dorsum and sole of the foot.
The toes were anesthetic. A cold foot bath increased the
pains, and a warm foot bath diminished them (contrary to
experience in analgesias).</p>

<p>This was a case of synesthesialgia in the right foot,
brought about by rubbing dry hands, exactly as if there were
a direct contact with the foot. Milder painful reactions were
brought about by bright lights and loud noises; but on the
whole, these other effects were insignificant. It must be
remembered that the man was wounded and plainly had also
organic nervous disorder. He sometimes complained of
radiations of the pain up to the left hypochondrium, and
sometimes he showed the classical sensation of “esophageal
globus” (lump in the throat). In short, there was in him
a special excitability of the nervous system which may partly
explain the synesthesialgia.</p>

<h4><b>Case 317.</b> (<span class="smcap">Gaupp</span>, March, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A reservist, 28 (laborer in civil life, of a nervous family;
even before mobilization had attacks of weakness at his
work or in the company of others) January 3 or 4, 1915,
fainted in the trench while shells were striking around him.
On January 5 he was brought to hospital in deep stupor. He
went to the reserve hospital at N. by hospital train, January
8, and arrived at the Tübingen clinic January 18.</p>

<p>A slip of paper stated that after burial in the trench he had
been brought from the field unconscious. Clonic spasms of
the upper part of the body are said to have occurred. At the
reserve hospital in N., January 10, he was still unconscious,
at times twitching his face and the upper part of his body,
and once at night excited and delirious.</p>

<p>At first in the clinic he was apathetic, speaking not a word,
looking vacantly into the air as if lost in a dream. He went
to the section passively, and lay passively in bed.</p>

<p>In the examining room, he stood speechless with unemotional
face, sometimes looking up to the ceiling, slowly
scratching his head, failing to answer questions, although
fixing his eyes upon the physician. He could not be communicated
with in writing, playing uncomprehendingly with
the pencil or scratching his head with it. He would start
with fright at a sudden noise or an unexpected touch. Sometimes
he would heave a deep sigh, grasp his head in his
hands, or lay hold of his hair with a hopeless expression of
face and shake his head to and fro.</p>

<p>Next day, January 19, he made a few slow, low answers.
He was found to be entirely disoriented and with associations
impeded, although he could get out his name and residence
with difficulty. Some of his color identifications were correct,
such as red and green; some impossible, as yellow, brown,
violet. A comrade who was called in and could speak the
Cologne dialect, was talked with at first with difficulty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
later more easily. Although the patient was visibly freer,
he remained without apparent emotion, retaining a rigid and
dreamlike expression of face. It was hard to find words,
although objects were named correctly, and there was no
paraphasia or agnosia. Vision and hearing were normal;
walking, manual movements, eating were all undisturbed
though slow. The patient had to be led to the toilet. It
seemed as if all intellectual life was at rest, and that in the
absence of impulses from without, there would have been
complete apathy. It was made out that the patient thought
he was still in the trenches.</p>

<p>Next day, the stupor had decreased and the patient spoke,
getting his bearings for a time. There was a complete
amnesia as to the cause and duration of his condition. During
the next period, up to the beginning of February, 1915,
consciousness cleared and the apathy was replaced with
anxiety, weariness, and a dull headache.</p>

<p>During February, the patient gradually returned to his
senses, and remained in a state of general nervous exhaustion.
Amnesia was complete for at least two weeks of his
life and recollections were fragmentary for the first three
days of his stay in the clinic. He worked willingly in the
garden with the other patients. On February 26, the patient
was cured and went back to the reserve battalion in a much
strengthened condition.</p>

<p>Battles (including liquid fire); eventually shell-shock:
Hallucinatory delirium, mutism, asthenia&mdash;after
a few days puerilism (history of convulsive
crisis in adolescence) with regression of personality
to late childhood.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 318.</b> (<span class="smcap">Charon and Halberstadt</span>, November, 1916.)</h4>

<p>Puerilism (Dupré) appeared in a soldier, 21 (uncle and
cousin insane; patient had difficulty in studies at fourteen
and nervous spells for two years, with loss of consciousness,
fall and convulsions probably at rare intervals; a student at
eighteen) after he had taken part in a number of battles
with the Chasseurs Alpins. He was exposed once to liquid
fire July 21, 1916. He entered the military psychiatric center
at Amiens. Mental troubles had followed the bursting of
a shell near him. He said a few words, such as, “Alsace;
fire; blood; snow; it hurts.” These phrases, spoken in a
low tone, with an anxious appearance, eyes fixed, suggested
hallucination. He seemed to be listening. Aside from the
isolated words above mentioned he showed complete mutism.
There was physical weakness, difficulty in walking without
support, exaggeration of patellar reflexes, pains in the head
and limbs. After several days, he said, “Milk; bread.”
After this the anxiety and the slow and difficult walking disappeared,
whereupon the puerilism appeared.</p>

<p>Now the soldier began to run instead of walking. He
galloped and gamboled like a child imitating a horse, or he
would sit on a board seeming to paddle. He would skip
along the halls. The puerilistic phases were rather brief and
for the most part he lay in bed. There was still a certain asthenia.
He made little paper boats in bed, keeping them in
a small metal box along with bits of bread, looking glass and
the like. If a gesture was made to take them away, he
would protest and press the box to his breast, looking childish
and anxious, and if the box were taken he would weep hot
tears. Sometimes he would stick out his tongue at the
attendants. His mother came to see him and afterwards he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
would say, “Mamma told me to be good, to eat well, to get
well and to go home.” He would use childish grammar,&mdash;“Me
eat much.” Asked why he had hollowed out a small
hole in the wall of the room, he answered, “I did it for fun,
but I will not do it any more. Mother doesn’t want me to.”
The patient was unwilling to answer a question correctly;
would sometimes answer incorrectly at first and correctly
afterward.</p>

<p>It appears that the man had adopted the language, occupations
and attitude of a child, showing a regression of personality
ten to twelve years backwards. There was a neurotic
basis in the convulsive crises of adolescence. On the basis
of this predisposition following shock there appeared an attack
of confusion, upon which, several days later, supervened
ecmnesic phenomena of hysterical nature assuming all
the features of puerilism.</p>

<h4><b>Case 319.</b> (<span class="smcap">Lattes and Goria</span>, March, 1917.)</h4>

<p>M. Alessandro, Class ’79, baker (father a drunkard;
brother an idiot, in asylum), had typhus in youth, and as a
boy had periods of intense “pavor nocturnus,” but no convulsions.
He enjoyed good health in the army before the
following event:</p>

<p>On July 13, 1915, a bomb, dropped by an airplane, fell
near an Italian soldier, killing many comrades, and throwing
the man to the ground unconscious. He awoke several
hours later at a hospital in a stunned condition. During
the night, under the influence of terrifying dreams, he would
leave his bed to look for enemies who, it seemed to him, were
throwing stones and firing. He managed to grasp a rifle and
fire at the images he saw. He was given a 60 days’ leave of
absence during which he did not improve; and then again
90 days’ furlough, which he spent at his home, where terrifying
dreams, tremor of limbs and asthenia continued.</p>

<p>He came under observation February 10, after his second
leave. Nutrition fair. Insomnia. Constant terrifying
dreams. Coated tongue. Tremor of hands, head, body,
ceasing during voluntary movements. Episodically he had
spells of dizziness followed by absent-mindedness, whereupon
he wandered aimlessly about, of a sudden becoming aware of
being in a place, but not knowing how he came there.</p>

<p>Special senses intact. Several points of cutaneous hyperesthesia,
particularly mammary and pseudo-ovarian on the
left, pressure whereon provoked a lively emotional reaction
with acceleration of pulse, redness, lacrimation. Knee reflexes
lively, cutaneous reflexes normal, except the plantar
which were very lively. Restless, hyperemotional, he wept
for insignificant reasons and wanted to leave hospital for fear
of dying there. He was discharged unimproved after a fortnight.</p>

</div>

<h4><b>Case 320.</b> (<span class="smcap">Bennati</span>, October, 1916.)</h4>

<p>An Italian private in the infantry was recalled to military
service. He was a small farmer, and being disposed to homesickness,
grew depressed from the day he left for service.
His sleep was disturbed, he was greatly affected by the wet
and damp of the trenches, and was in a state of continual
fear. Finally, pains, hypersensitiveness, and fever developed.</p>

<p>As an enemy airplane passed over one day, a box fell at
the man’s feet and threw him into a profound fear with
tears. He was conducted to a tent to rest; his regiment
was shortly sent to the rear, and he remained on active service
for a few days despite the fever and pains. Finally the
swelling of his leg compelled him to take to bed. (Fatigue in
antebellum life had always shown itself in aches of the legs.)
He had now been in active service about a month and his
homesickness overcame him. He was in a state of deep
physical and mental depression. It was not his own troubles
so much as those of his family which preoccupied him. His
knees hurt him so that he had to weep; or if Sardinia was
mentioned, he cried, and said, “Oh, how I love Sardinia!”
He grew fatigued very easily. He had many dreams about
Sardinia, his father, and the war, especially dreaming about
being wounded in the legs (question of being stimulated by
the joint aches). The reflexes were normal, though slight
tremors set up in the legs after testing. The thyroid gland
was somewhat swollen, and it appears that the patient had
noticed this five days before entering hospital. The patient
was rather vagotonic; pulse-rate stood at 56; oculocardiac-reflex,
56-84; Mannkopf negative; Thomayer and Erben
marked (56-88 and 88-60); von Graefe marked; Stellwag
present.</p>

<p>A shell pitches without bursting: Unconsciousness;
stupor; MAMA MIA!; oniric delirium; amnesia.
Recovery in five weeks.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 321.</b> (<span class="smcap">Lattes and Goria</span>, March, 1917.)</h4>

<p>An Italian soldier of the Class of ’95, a mechanic (mother
cardiac; as a boy, pains in joints and heart; since boyhood,
no illness), had a big Austrian shell pitch near him, July 23,
1915. The shell failed to explode and injured no one. The
patient, however, fell to the ground, unconscious, and remained
in the camp hospital for two days, quite immobile.
This event followed an advance by his company under very
fatiguing circumstances without sleep for a period of four
days.</p>

<p>July 26, the patient was observed in profound stupor, non-reactive,
constantly and monotonously repeating the phrase,
<i>Mama mia!</i>, with fixed gaze and smiling as if at visions. He
swallowed food. The pupils reacted poorly to light, and the
cornea and nasal mucosa seemed anesthetic. The tendon
and skin reflexes were lively. The muscles were hypotonic;
bradycardia, 56; no control over feces or urine.</p>

<p>July 27-28, restlessness at night, gasping movements, and
poses of terror.</p>

<p>July 29, he called for his mother, who had been dead for
several years. He was still stuporous and insensible.</p>

<p>From August 1 to 10, he improved slowly and became
able to carry bread to his mouth after it had been put in his
hands. He still did not speak and made signs when he
wished to urinate or defecate. Pulse 50-60.</p>

<p>August 12, the patient began to react to intense light and
to pain stimuli, as well as to pressure. He ate voraciously.</p>

<p>August 15, visual stimuli were responded to, the pulse had
risen to 80, the skin reflexes were no less lively. There began
to be terrifying dreams at night, with motor reactions.</p>

<p>August 17, the patient looked about more alertly, promptly
seeing bread when placed in the center of the field of vision
and saying words to the man who might try to remove the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
bread. He did not yet react to acoustic stimuli, nor was
there any other change up to August 21.</p>

<p>August 22 a notable improvement set in. The hearing
was now slightly diminished, questions were answered after
a brief refractory period. After a few questions, however,
a state of exhaustion would ensue, which would disappear
only after a short rest. There was amnesia for the entire
period following the day of his departure for the front, May,
1915. At this time, instead of eating voraciously, he showed
anorexia. The skin and tendon reflexes, instead of being
lively, were now dull. There still were battle dreams of
enemies trying to kill him.</p>

<p>August 25, there was an area of hypesthesia on the inner
aspect of the right thigh, but otherwise no disorder of sensation.
The pulse stood at 80 and there were no other neurological
phenomena.</p>

<p>August 31, the patch of hypesthesia of the thigh and the
retrograde amnesia disappeared. There was still a slight
diminution of hearing. The accident of the non-exploding
bomb could now be recalled, but there was a memory gap for
all facts up to the latter part of August.</p>

<p>September 2, dreamless sleep; no signs of abnormality
except a slight diminution of hearing. Discharged, well.</p>

<h4><b>Case 322.</b> (<span class="smcap">Lattes and Goria</span>, March, 1917.)</h4>

<p>An Italian of the Class of 1891 (convulsions and pains in
the spine, with rigidity, as a child; typhoid fever at 18;
brother sickly, neuropathic; mother subject to periodic convulsions;
father alcoholic and nervous), on the night of
November 26, 1915, was carrying a number of tubes of explosives.
A comrade stumbled and fell over the soldier,
who fell to the ground unconscious. None of the glycerine
tubes exploded, and none of the soldiers round about were
hurt.</p>

<p>The man regained consciousness at the camp hospital,
but remained deafmute and also impaired as to vision. It
was as if a screen of fog lay between him and objects seen.</p>

<p>During fifteen days of observation at the camp hospital,
he had terrible war nightmares. The mutism, the visual
disorder, and the deafness then gradually disappeared without
special treatment.</p>

<p>However, when the patient rose from bed, it was found
that his lumbar vertebral column was stiff. He walked bent
forward and was unable to bend or straighten the back.
There was a hyperesthesia along the vertebrae, especially on
pressure. X-ray examination showed no bone lesion. The
larynx and cornea were sensitive, and the plantar reflexes
were absent. The abdominal reflexes were present. The
pupils reacted to light and accommodation. There were
two areas of analgesia in the nipple regions. The expression
of the patient’s face was relaxed and drooping.</p>

healthy; non-alcoholic; good scholar) was, July 19, 1915,
helping drag a heavy cannon up hill. The big gun slid, hit
several men, and grazed the patient, making a slight abrasion
on his leg. He immediately lost consciousness, and
arrived at the camp hospital in a stupor, which lasted so
long that catheterization was necessary.</p>

<p>A week later he was observed in hospital, immobile and
non-reactive, with a swollen abdomen and fecal impaction.
The pupils were widely dilated and reacted poorly to light.
The corneal reflexes were absent, and the nasal mucosa was
anesthetic. Pulse 50. The patient failed to eat. Next
day there was no change in his condition. He was quiet
throughout the night.</p>

<p>On the morning of July 29, a number of answers were
obtained to questions put in a loud voice, though he was
unaware of much more than his name, being ignorant of the
name of his country, his age, his division, where he had come
from, what had happened to him, or where he was. He had
now begun to eat spontaneously.</p>

<p>During the following days, up to August 4, the amnesia
gradually dissolved for the facts before the trauma. He
remembered having been greatly frightened at the time of
the accident but could not remember the accident itself, and
the gap for subsequent events was still complete. The
pharyngeal reflex was still poor. August 5, he began to remember
the details concerning the accident. About the
middle of August there was no longer any diminution of
hearing and ideation became more free and rapid.</p>

<p>September 4, he was discharged, well.</p>

knocked about ten yards.” Then he began to shake but
carried on.</p>

<p>Two days later, “Shells dropped on the dug-out and killed

<p>Forced marches; skirmishes; rheumatism: Generalized
TREMORS. On the road to recovery in six
months.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 327.</b> (<span class="smcap">Binswanger</span>, July, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A German letter carrier, 27, entered the war at the outset,
made forced marches in great heat, was in a number of skirmishes
and in the capture of Namur, and fell ill early in
September, with swollen and painful right foot and rheumatic
pains in knees and shoulders. He was put on garrison duty;
but the rheumatic pains in the joints increased toward the end
of September, and he was treated in hospital for rheumatism.</p>

<p>He became able to walk only in the second half of December,
marked tremors affecting the whole body. His bodily
condition had been good. He slept well, and while at rest in
bed he felt entirely well; but upon every attempt to get up
and put his feet down, these violent trembling motions would
always reappear. Treatment by hydro- and electrotherapy
remained entirely unsuccessful. February 8 he was transferred
to a nerve hospital.</p>

<p>He had been in the postal service from 1903. He was of
normal bodily and mental development and had had no
previous illnesses. His military service had been executed
from 1909 to 1911. He had always been a passionate smoker
but had not abused alcohol. His mother is said to have been
for some time paralyzed, following a fright.</p>

<p>Physically, the patient was a slender but strongly-built
and fairly well-nourished soldier. The first sound at the
apex of the heart was rough and impure, and the heart was
somewhat enlarged to the left. The pulse was irregular,
106. The arteries were somewhat stiff. Neurologically,
there was a marked dermatographia of comparatively long
duration. The periosteal reflexes were increased; the deep
reflexes could not be properly examined. The whole leg
trembled and heaved unsuccessfully on attempts to raise it
voluntarily. After even a slight stroke on the patellar
tendon, the trembling became excessive and irregular, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
the leg passed into a heaving spasm which would outlast
the percussion for some time. The patellar clonus could
be obtained with the knee extended. The shaking movements
were somewhat more marked on the right than on
the left side. Similar phenomena occurred when the Achilles
reflexes were being examined. The triceps reflexes on both
sides were increased but there was no tremor or spasm of
the arms. The plantar reflexes were very lively, and following
these reflexes appeared tremors of the legs. When
the spinous processes of the vertebral column were percussed,
a general shaking spasm appeared. Tactile sense
was everywhere normal, but the pain sense was increased.
Upon slight pin-pricks in the skin of the legs, there would
occur a marked shaking spasm of the leg, passing directly
to the other leg. These phenomena were more marked on
the right side than on the left. When sitting upon a chair
with back supported, a slight tremor would appear when
the hands were raised and stretched out, more markedly on
the right side than on the left. Movements of the arms were
normal. However, the hand-grasps were: right, 105; left,
80. In dorsal decubitus the movements of the leg were
performed comparatively well at first, but after a few repetitions,
the shaking spasm would occur on both sides, and
the movements would become very awkward. The heel-to-knee
test would then fail. If the patient were put on his
feet, he would immediately fall into spasms, first in the right
leg, then in the left. The trunk would now be involved,
and soon the arms, whereupon the whole body, with the
exception of the head, would be seen trembling and shaking,
and the patient would fall forward, trying to get support by
leaning against a wall, seizing a chair, or sinking down slowly.
The spasms disappeared at once in dorsal decubitus and in
sitting with supported back. Outward irritation by the
acoustic, optic or tactile avenues would bring out spasms in
the legs, always more markedly on the right side than on the
left. Psychic irritations would cause spasms. The muscles
of the limbs were held in great tension, the flexors and extensors
being alternately affected. When the patient was
moving along a wall with a difficult, swaying gait, his efforts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
reminded the examiner of the attempts of a heavily intoxicated
man to walk. Upon attempts to create passive movements
of the lower limbs, severe shaking and trembling movements
set in, followed by a general spastic tension of the leg musculature
such that it could not be further flexed or extended.</p>

<p>The patient was put in the psychiatric section, as too
seriously ill for the nerve hospital. He improved after a
few days, being then able to walk without much support
although still with some shaking and tremor. If his attention
was diverted, passive movement of the leg could be
carried out without developing spasm. He was treated in a
room by himself with removal of all outward irritation.
His legs were treated for an hour, three times daily, by
means of moist packs. On account of complaints of insomnia
he was given small doses of hypnotics.</p>

<p>The main thing here, according to Binswanger, is the
psychotherapy. The patient was told almost daily in the
course of conversation, first, that the illness was being
cured; secondly, that upon recovery he would be employed
in the future only on the postal service. He was told that
he would have to avoid marked physical exertion, of course,
but that he still would be fit for office work and could serve
the fatherland in this way. Still he could not be transferred
back to the hospital, he was told, unless he became
entirely well, so that he could move with perfect freedom.</p>

<p>February 23 the patient was performing daily exercises in
walking and standing; the spasm became very slight on
standing, and often would entirely cease, but it remained
still plainly present in the legs; the trunk and arms were
free. External irritations were now less prone to excite
spasm. Sleep became quiet and dreamless. He was transferred
to the nerve hospital, able to move about freely in
house and garden and only tremulous after long walks and
considerable bodily and mental fatigue. He was given a
week’s furlough home. He wished very much to get into
the postal service; at the time of the report he had not
attained this goal. He had renewed attacks of trembling
upon exertion, and was transferred at the end of June to a
convalescent home.</p>

<p>Shell-shock; emotion: Hyperkinesis, fear, dreams.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 328.</b> (<span class="smcap">Mott</span>, January, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A private, 21, was with 30 men carrying sandbags in the
daylight, under shell fire. He was thrown into a deep hole
by an explosion, climbed out, and saw all his mates dead.</p>

<p>He was admitted to the Fourth London General Hospital,
June 20, 1915, having been at Boulogne for a fortnight. He
was lying in bed on his back, making continuous jerky lateral
movements of head, and movements of arms, especially of
the left arm. He was groaning slightly, now and then raising
his eyelids with a staring expression of bewilderment and
terror. He was able to mutter answers to questions. He
would occasionally raise his right hand to his forehead. If he
was observed, these movements became exaggerated. They
ceased in sleep. He muttered even when unobserved. He continually
said, “You won’t let me back.” Asked as to dreams,
he replied, “Guns.” Voluntary movements were made, which
prevented obtaining reflexes. When his pupils were to be
examined by a man in uniform, he showed a marked facies
of terror; his pupils were dilated; the eyes opened wide, the
brows were furrowed, and there was an anxious scowl. The
flash of an electric light produced the same effect.</p>

<p>June 24 the patient was much better. He said the explosion
which had killed his friends after he had been only a
few weeks at the front, was the first serious event in his
service. He kept seeing it again, with bright lights and
bursting shells. Sometimes he would hear the men shouting.
In dreams he both saw and heard shells and men. There
was pain in the back and right side of the head.</p>

<p>June 26 he was improved but still had pain in the back of
the head, especially when trying to remember, and a slight
tremor of the hands. He had been given hot baths at
Boulogne on account of being very cold and shivering. He
had always felt sick at the sight of blood. He was boarded
for Home Service six months after admission.</p>

<p>Shell fire and barbed-wire work: Tremors, anesthesias,
temperature and pain hallucinations.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 329.</b> (<span class="smcap">Myers</span>, March, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A corporal, 39, had been working under shell fire at
barbed-wire entanglements. The man was big and robust,
but much depressed, complaining of noises in the head,
pricking pains, unsteady legs, fatigue, irritability, loss of
confidence. He showed tremors of arms and legs on movement,
and stood unsteadily with eyes closed. He said: “My
legs have been very unsteady, especially when some one is
looking at me. They must have thought me drunk at times.”</p>

<p>The head and tongue were tremulous, the knee-jerks
exaggerated, the soles insensitive to touch and pain; but
sensibility to deep pressure was retained. There was a
gradual return of right answers on further trials, aided by
comparison with effects of stimuli applied to the dorsum of
the foot. Though he gave correct replies on heat and cold
tests over the arms, he gave wrong answers over the dorsum
of the feet, less often over legs, sometimes over thighs.</p>

<p>Later during examination, the feet became tremulous.
He felt a “silly childish fear,” and his hands began to feel cold
and clammy; whereupon he began to reply <i>hot</i> or <i>cold</i> when
the tubes were not applied at all (temperature hallucinations).
There were apparently pain hallucinations in the
soles and errors in response to the compasses.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> the temperature hallucinations noted by Myers, these
are to be distinguished from true vasomotor disorders.
Babinski believes that he has definitely established that,
though hysteria may cause a slight thermo-asymmetry, yet
never a definite vasomotor or thermic disorder.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> hysterical pains, the most frequent are probably those
of hysterical pseudo sciatica, in which true signs of sciatica
are absent, namely, (1) loss of Achilles jerk, (2) scoliosis,
(3) Lasègue’s sign (pain on thigh flexion with leg extension),
(4) Neri’s sign (with trunk bent forward, affected knee
flexed), and (5) Bonnet’s sign (pain on thigh adduction).</p>

<p>Shell-shock: Emotional crises; twice recurrent

gets off with transient phenomena.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 330.</b> (<span class="smcap">Mairet, Piéron and Bouzansky</span>, June, 1915.)</h4>

<p>December 15, sitting back of a wall were three minor officers
and an <i>homme de liaison</i>, when a 105 shell punctured the wall
and burst, killing one and wounding another severely. One
of these, <i>a sous-lieutenant</i>, lost consciousness for a quarter of
an hour and had some severe headaches for a few days, but
nothing more. The other, the <i>homme de liaison</i>, was found
standing, bewildered, looking at the dead. When his name
was called, he jumped and started off, weeping and crying
out.</p>

<p>When caught, he was still somewhat clear, recognized his
superior officer, answered yes and no, but kept asking,
“Where is the other?” Next day he kept weeping and said
not a word.</p>

<p>He was evacuated through a series of hospitals and was
sent to convalesce with his sister at Montpellier, having now
got back his speech. He had a seizure of fear in the street
and was picked up by the police and was carried to a general
hospital January 21. Here he could not speak, could hardly
write, being unable to find his words. He walked slowly,
bent over, eyes abnormally wide open, with a look of terror.
The lighting of a match made him start off weeping. The
symptom picture included tinnitus, vertigo, deafness, some
reduction of the visual field (especially on the left side),
hypesthesia and hypalgesia on the left side, hyperalgesia on
the right, painful points (epigastric, inguinal, supra and infra
mammary left), reflex, muscular and tendon, hyperexcitability
on right side, jactitation, impairment of recollective
memory, complete memory gap for the accident and everything
thereafter, retentive memory reduced, imagination
impaired, nightmares (awaking with a start).</p>

<p>A few days later he was able to pronounce his name with
difficulty and to say yes and no. February 4 there was an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
appendicular crisis, whereupon mutism became absolute
again and lasted into May, despite suggestive therapy.</p>

<p>May 10, improvement in memory for things before the
accident grew better, nightmares had become less frequent,
the jactitation had continued.</p>

<p>There was no neuropathic predisposition in this case except
infantile convulsions in two sisters, followed by nervous crises
in one.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> appendicular crisis, which was the occasion of a relapse
in mutism, see remarks under relapses under <a href="#case292">Case 292</a>.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> mutism, Babinski counts mutism, hysteria major, and
rhythmic chorea as so characteristically hysterical that no
nervous disturbance of an organic nature can resemble them.
The description of hysterical mutism is due to Charcot.
According to Babinski, mutism is just as curable as hysterical
deafness, and perhaps more curable. Yet mutism persists
unchanged for many months unless it is treated properly by
some form of suggestion. “It may be almost said that a
subject suffering from speech defect, who nevertheless succeeds
in making other people understand by all sorts of
varied and expressive gestures the circumstances of his condition,
is a hysterical mute and not an aphasic.” According to
Babinski, no true case of hysterical aphasia has been published
since the beginning of the war; all the cases have been
cases of mutism.</p>

<p>Shell explosion; fainting: Hysterical crises of
emotion; fright at a frog in the garden. Hereditary
and acquired neuropathic taint.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 331.</b> (<span class="smcap">Claude, Dide and Lejonne</span>, April, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A lieutenant, 28 (mother nervous; father had nervous
spells at fifteen; patient himself nervous as a child), was under
a great moral strain at the outbreak of war, and was utterly
exhausted in a hard battle that lasted more than twenty-four
hours.</p>

<p>A shell burst near him September 25 at the Somme, whereupon
he fainted. He was evacuated to Amiens for three
weeks; kept his bed; somnambulistic; subject to nervous
crises.</p>

<p>He passed to the hospital of Ferté-Bernard for a month,
the crises becoming more frequent. He was sent to a convalescent
dépôt for three days, thence for three months to
La Plisse; got better; lived at home, but went to a show
where they played the <i>Marseillaise</i>, was profoundly moved
thereby, and had more crises; accordingly went back under
medical care and finally to his dépôt, where, upon seeing his
old comrades, he had more crises, and was finally evacuated
to the neurological center of the Eighth Region.</p>

<p>He there seemed mistrustful when asked to tell his story.
There was a noise of cannon, whereupon he got up, ran in all
directions in the garden, bumping into trees in the greatest
terror, yelling, “There they are!”; gesticulating, soliloquizing:
“Bomb! Shell! Bayonet!” His pulse was rapid. After he
was calmed down, he began to talk again in a very clear,
distinct, somewhat tremulous voice. A metallic sound made
him shudder and cry out, “The drums!” and another scene
of rushing about followed.</p>

<p>In the consulting office he wept. Battle dreams and nightmares,
soliloquies and terror, seminal losses, occurred during
the next few days.</p>

<p>August 4, while alone in the garden, he heard a noise, went
toward it and spied a frog, whereupon he had another crisis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
of fear and emotion. He got another lieutenant, and both
returned, sticks in hand. Pointing to a hole in the earth,
Lieutenant A. said, “Trenches! There they are!” “What?
Who?” said Lieutenant B. “The Boches!” said Lieutenant
A. Whereupon Lieutenant B also saw them and cried out
bravely, “Go away!” However, the second lieutenant immediately
saw that he had been the subject of suggestive
hallucination.</p>

<p>Fifteen days of calm followed, during which the lieutenant
became more sociable and grew better having no more
crises.</p>

<p>Four other cases of “hysteroemotive nature” are reported
by Claude, all of them showing a special constitutional basis
before the war. In the differential diagnosis, alcoholism,
cyclothymia, obsessive psychosis and occasionally systematized
delusional psychosis may be considered. There were
occasional stereotypical features in the cases, but of a very
fugitive nature. Dementia praecox is hardly to be considered.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> “hysteroemotive” cases, Babinski holds that the claim
of emotion as a single factor capable of causing hysteria by
itself, is a false claim. To be sure, the patients themselves
may give accounts which lead to the idea of an emotional
hysteria. Dide, one of the authors of the above case, states
that functional disorders occur only in subjects whose emotional
tone has been relaxed. The heaviest bombardments
are not in line to produce these disorders when the morale
of the troops is good. The bloodiest affairs may leave no
single case of nervous disorder when the morale is good.
Dide found in a whole year’s work but a single functional
case,&mdash;an oniric delirium, following a trench mortar explosion.
Roselle and Oberthür also state on the basis of intensive
experience, that large projectiles do not cause any
intensive emotional reactions. Clunet’s observations upon
the shipwrecked <i>La Provence II</i>, quoted by Babinski, run in
the same direction. It will be noted that the five cases called
“hysteroemotive” showed a special constitutional basis
antebellum.</p>

<p>War strain; slight wound; burials; shell-shock:
Neurosis with anxiety; war dreams; apparent recovery.
Relapse with depression.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 332.</b> (<span class="smcap">MacCurdy</span>, July, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A man, 27 (normal mischievous boy, successful in work,
unmarried, shy with women), enlisted October, 1914; adapted
himself well to training; at first enjoyed his work, though
later bored with routine; and in February, 1915, went to the
firing line in France. The first shell-fire experience made
him break into a cold sweat with fear and slowed him down
for a time. However, he enjoyed the active operations until,
after eight months in the trenches, he was invalided home with
nephritis. After four months’ convalescence he was recommended
for a commission, obtained after two months’ training.
After two further months in the regimental dépôt, he went
back to France as lieutenant in June, 1916, plunging into four
months of heavy fighting on the Somme, in which he was
wounded slightly once and was one day buried three times by
earth from shell explosion. The last time he was buried he
was unconscious for ten minutes and was relieved for three
days. He got frequently knocked out for short periods by
shell concussion.</p>

<p>At the end of October, 1916, he was sent to the Ypres section,
where he worked with a pioneer battalion that buried many
dead. After a month of this pioneer work he became mildly
depressed; fatigue set in, and now for the first time he began
to jump nervously when the shells came over. To counteract
this nervousness he began to drink and in a fortnight developed
insomnia. The Somme front scenes kept constantly
in mind as he tried to sleep. He felt as if he had to go up to
the trenches next day and that he did not want to go. There
were hypnagogic hallucinations of trenches and shells, recognized
as imaginary and productive of no fear. Week by week
he became more nervous, became unable to locate shell falls,
and felt as if they were all coming at him. Early in 1917 he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
had taken heavily to drink and grew greatly fatigued in the
struggle to prevent betraying his fear to his men. The horror
at bloodshed, to which he had long since become accustomed,
reappeared. He actually wished that he might be killed.</p>

<p>He carried on until March, when one day on a raid seven
men were killed around him and he was immediately thereafter
buried. He reported sick and was found to be somewhat
febrile. He carried on for two more days; had to
report sick again; was sent to hospital and for two or three
weeks had bad headaches back of the eyes and a sleep interrupted
by sudden wakings with a start. Nightmares now
began for the first time. They dealt with the Somme front,
merciless shelling coming nearer and nearer. Finally, he
would wake with a shriek when a shell landed on top of him.
In the day time any noise would be interpreted as a shell.
Hypnagogic hallucinations of Germans entering the room
appeared. After a little over a week in French hospitals he
was transferred to London; grew better; was sent to a
hospital in the country where outdoor exercise and recreation
helped him.</p>

<p>Two weeks later the death of one of his best friends depressed
him a good deal. He failed in an attempt to sing at
a concert, and then grew much worse, with the old dreams
every night and hypochondriacal complaints of sweats and
loss of weight. He was convinced that he was physically
and nervously a permanent wreck.</p>

<p>According to MacCurdy, this case is a typical case of war
neurosis of the anxiety type, except that a relapse with depression
is somewhat atypical.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> anxiety, Lépine counts trauma as one of the most
important factors. The reduction of morale in physically
injured cases may at times require their rapid withdrawal to
a safety zone. The delirium of the physically injured sometimes
takes on a melancholic tinge. Fatigue, loss of sleep,
and cold are other factors of a physical nature. Among
the moral factors, Lépine thinks responsibility (for certain
<i>âmes scrupuleuses</i>) is hardly less important than the factor
of felt danger. The contacts of highly cultivated men with
the rougher soldier element, may also count, as well as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
separation from home and friends, and the factor of despair
concerning the ending of the war.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> sexual influences, the factor of sexual continence, though
it may have some importance in producing morbid anxiety,
seems to have less importance under war conditions, when
self-preservation is more in the eye than the sexual life. On
the whole, the pre-existent emotional constitution (Dupré)
is of greater importance. A previous wound may cause a
man to acquire such a constitution. Amongst physical
states, hypotensives are candidates for depression; tuberculosis
is particularly important.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> MacCurdy’s case, the factor of alcoholism was mentioned.
The importance of alcoholism, Lépine has particularly
stressed. He particularly emphasizes the number of
men who have taken to drink to get over their emotions and
to forget. Visual hallucinations, angry excitability, sudden
persecutory ideas, nocturnal occurrence of the symptoms,
flushing of the face, suggest alcoholism. Some of the cases
of encephalitis which are supposed to be due to some unknown
bacterium, may really be alcoholic in origin. A third
of Lépine’s cases were alcoholic; perhaps two-thirds really
alcoholic if one took into account the factor of sensitization.</p>

<p>Bombardment from airplanes: Fear; suicidal
thoughts; oniric delirium (“moving picture in the
head.”)</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 333.</b> (<span class="smcap">Hoven</span>, May, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A soldier (born at seven months, somewhat feebleminded,
given to depression, early victim of convulsions, talking only
at five years, with a history of once leaving his father’s house
with suicidal ideas after being scolded, already invalided in
peace times) on enlistment remained with the regiment but
a few days and was then sent to a workers’ company of
blacksmiths.</p>

<p>Toward the end of February, 1916, his cantonment was
bombarded by an airplane escadrille. The patient was much
frightened, ran away and hid in a ditch, felt sick, stopped
eating, wanted to kill himself and had to be evacuated to
Calais and then to Chateaugiron.</p>

<p>He was there found to be well oriented, but depressed and
bewildered. There was an emotional tachycardia. At night
he would fall into a delirium like the oniric delirium of Régis,
always dreaming of the same bombardment scene, saying it
was like a <i>moving picture in his head</i>. The delirium affected
him so that he actually tried to make away with himself.</p>

<p>The dream delirium did not last long but recurred several
times on very slight emotional occasions. It was possible to
excite his hallucinatory dreams experimentally by showing
him battle pictures.</p>

<p>Some cases of such delirium develop, according to Hoven,
after moving picture shows of battle scenes.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> oniric delirium, Chavigny states that mental confusion
and oniric delirium are the two forms of mental disorder that
come most frequently after explosions. He believes that at
least 95 per cent of these cases are rapidly curable; and, in
fact, found amongst 60 cases observed in his army service
that only two were so severe as to require being sent to the
interior: all the others were cured in six days at the outside.
These cases, according to Chavigny, ought to be treated in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
special wards at the front (bed, quiet, purgation, baths).
Chavigny prearranges slight emotional shock for these cases
by talking with them about their families. Their apparent
apathy vanishes in a trice.</p>

<p>Régis, who has named the state “oniric delirium,” states
that the condition never lasts more than a fortnight, is
caused by emotional shock, and occurs in all cases with
mental disorder following battle; but similar hallucinatory
conditions have begun to appear also amongst alcoholics,
in garrison or at home. There is emotional constitution in
most of these cases. There is not so much evidence of
heredity. Out of 50 of Régis’ cases, 22 had been wounded,
and 28 not. Régis states that the psychoses are rather more
apt to affect men in the reserve, and are severest in officers.
These cases should not be committed to institutions, but
ought to be treated in special military psychiatric wards containing
separate rooms. Very fine-spun diagnosis may be
necessary now and again on account of the occurrence of
infectious deliria and phenomena of the banal psychoses that
may closely resemble oniric deliria.</p>

<p>Shell-shock; emotion (best friend mangled): Stupor
with amnesia.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 334.</b> (<span class="smcap">Gaupp</span>, March, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A soldier, 23 (in civil life a turner, of Polish descent, and of
a somewhat nervous and easily excitable disposition), early
in August went from Strassburg into the Vosges and Lorraine.
August 26 a number of shells exploded near him. The troop
was excited and took refuge in a cellar. His best friend was
torn to pieces by a shell. When the body was removed, the
man felt sick and lost consciousness. He arrived at the clinic
in Tübingen in a stuporous condition, by hospital train,
August 31, 1914. He walked weakly to his bed, supported
by two men, and lay in the bed, apathetic and reacting to
questions only with a stare. Things put in his mouth were
swallowed. He remained motionless.</p>

<p>Next evening he answered a low <i>Yes</i> to a nurse’s question
about eating. A little afterwards, he said he supposed he
was a prisoner in the enemy’s country. A while later he got
properly oriented but still did not know how he had come.
September 2, however, he was much clearer and said he had
awakened out of a long dream. There was a complete
amnesia, however, from the moment when he went to help
remove the torn body of his friend up to September 1. Memories
became clearer for the period before the shell explosion.
The patient became very lively, talking vividly of war
experiences, imitating the hiss of shells with an expression of
intense anxiety, getting accustomed to the battle scenes,
saying that he was now seeing everything again as if real. He
remained anxious for some days, complaining of weight on
his chest and of feelings of inner restlessness and tension.</p>

<p>Amnesia for the period August 26 to September 1 remained;
all that he could say was that he had been thrown
sidewise for some distance by the air pressure of the shell.</p>

<p>From September 6 onwards, he grew calmer but he was
still very labile, given to lively imaginings and emotion. By
mid September he could be discharged for garrison duty.</p>

</div>

<h4><b>Case 335.</b> (<span class="smcap">Rows</span>, April, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A man after a charge was placed on outpost duty. It was
dark, and he was in a state of considerable tension. He heard
a noise which he thought came from somewhere in front of
him. Suddenly the space around him was illuminated by a
flare of light, and he saw a man crawling over the bank.
Without challenging, he fired and killed the man. Next
morning, he found to his horror that he had killed a wounded
Englishman, who had advanced beyond his comrades and
was crawling back.</p>

<p>A physical expression of horror, together with an intense
sweating and a very marked stammer, persisted for months.
At the same time, he was tormented with a fearful nightmare,
and in his sleep he was heard to say, “It was an accidental
shot, sir; yes, Major, it was not my fault.” In the day time,
also, his attention was concentrated on the memory of the
incident, so that “I cannot forget it no matter how I skylark.”
Carrying his story back to this trying time led to
his recounting his terrible secret, and a marked improvement
followed. The physical signs of the intense emotion gradually
disappeared. The vividness of the dreams diminished,
and his attention was less concentrated on the one
subject. It is interesting to note that the production of a
marked emotional state by the death of one of his children
led to a recrudescence of his former symptoms: an expression
of “horror and the stammer.” But they disappeared again
in a short time.</p>

<h4><b>Case 336.</b> (<span class="smcap">Bennati</span>, October, 1916.)</h4>

<p>An Italian corporal in the infantry, a robust man of a well-to-do
family, took a good deal of pleasure in the war life.
One day a comrade was injured by a missile of some sort, and
died almost immediately. This comrade, after being hurt,
had thrown himself against the corporal, who was asleep at
the time. He woke up sharply and immediately felt sick.
His status was one of great terror, lacrimation, lack of
spontaneity, and insomnia. He would wake up from sleep
and start from a terrible dream. He had a number of phobias
and was especially interested in other persons who had the
same sort of mental state as himself. He was in a state
noted by Bennati as one of “emotional anaphylaxis” to
various events around him. There was a horizontal nystagmus,
the Mannkopf sign was positive (87-72), Thomayer
90-114, Erben 114-90. There was a slight tendency to
dizziness when the Erben movements were made.</p>

<h4><b>Case 337.</b> (<span class="smcap">Wiltshire</span>, June, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A sapper of 19, with a nervous mother, had had an attack
two years before his war neurosis, of a somewhat similar
nature. This former attack had been caused by overwork;
there had been no accident or fright, but the man had been
unable to work for five months.</p>

<p>At the front, he had been well up to ten days before observation.
In a dugout a shell had pitched on top of the bank,
followed by another shell bursting in front. There was a
slight falling in of the dugout but no special damage.</p>

<p>The patient carried on that night but reported sick next
morning, feeling queer and shaking slightly above the waist.
He remembered getting half-way down the road to see the
M. O., but nothing more until he came to in the dressing
station (perhaps 2½ hours later). After two days in hospital,
he was transferred to a convalescent camp, and then admitted
to another hospital. He complained of twitching and slight
frontal headache; funny feelings at night prevented his going
to sleep. Thus: “A man was over my head with a mallet,
going to hit me.” There was a dream of “somebody above
me all the time.” Both arms, head, and tongue were in a
state of constant tremor, and there were jerky movements of
the legs. There was some spasm of the right leg. Both legs
went into violent tremor on examination, and during examination
there was free perspiration.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> tremors, all sorts of tremors of unknown nature are
apt to get the designation <i>hysterical</i>. Meige believes that
the Shell-shock tremors, which are apt to be very persistent,
are very possibly due to changes in the nervous system.
Ballet has noted how the tremors, as in the above case,
are often associated with expressions of fear. Now and then
there is an obsessive disorder dubbed tremophobia by Meige,
which produces a vicious circle. Tremors lead to obsessions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
and the obsessions in turn exaggerate the tremors. These
Shell-shock tremors are apparently not related to (though
they may need differential diagnosis from) such conditions
as paralysis agitans, multiple sclerosis, hyperthyroidism, cerebellar
disease, neurosyphilis, and alcoholic or other intoxication.</p>

<p>Roussy and Lhermitte distinguish the tremors into (<i>a</i>)
atypical ones; that is, disorderly, irregular movements seemingly
determined by the subject’s caprice; and (<i>b</i>) typical
tremors, such as those found in the well-known nervous
diseases and presumably imitated in hysteria from these well-known
diseases. Generalized atypical tremors are, as a rule,
combined with a variety of other Shell-shock symptoms, and
often exhibit a sort of mimicry of fear.</p>

conditions idea of something nasty.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 338.</b> (<span class="smcap">Wiltshire</span>, June, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A private, 19, in the R. A. M. C., was sent in with a field
ambulance note as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Private &mdash;&mdash; was close to a shell which burst
among a company standing in the road, killing 20 and
wounding 20 others. He worked well in assisting the
wounded, and then proceeded to clear up the fragments
of the killed. Whilst doing this, he suddenly lost his
mental balance and has been in his present state nearly
24 hours. He has been given bromides.”</p>

<p>An M. O. attached to the same ambulance wrote:
“This man is suffering from mental shock caused by
having to clear away the remains of a number of men
killed by a shell. He does not recognize his friends,
and at frequent intervals has periods of terror, exclaiming,
‘Cover it up.’ He is sleepless (without drugs);
he takes food badly. He is possibly suicidal or may
become so.”</p>

</div>

<p>According to the patient himself, he had been quite well
for four months at the front. He was on the La Bassée Road
with the troops after a day or two of heavy work under shell
fire. “And I remember the flash of some shot and a shell
burst I think, and I can’t remember anything more. I awoke
in the morning, in the train” (48 hours later). “I can only
remember men calling out.” He complained of a feeling in
the head, as if expecting something. “Something seems to
be coming,&mdash;as if something was going to happen,&mdash;something
nasty, whenever I hear anything like the whistling of a
shell coming towards me.” This patient was without tremor
and was physically normal. So far as the patient’s own
story went, the case might well be regarded as one due to
physical concussion, but the notes of the medical officers give
evidence of a psychic element.</p>

<p>Depression with suicidal thoughts after witnessing

</div>

<h4><b>Case 339.</b> (<span class="smcap">Steiner</span>, October, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A farmer, 52, volunteered and was put in charge of a
drinking-water still. He had never been ill nor was there
any nervous or mental disease in his family. From the end
of August he was frequently under shell fire, but the only
effect thereof was a somewhat poorer sleep than normal.</p>

<p>December 14, 1914, a young comrade, a volunteer, wanted
to clean his dirty kettle at the drinking-water still. The
farmer later described this volunteer as a young fellow “like
milk and blood” (as we might say, “like peaches and cream”)
and as the handsomest young man he had ever seen in the
war. The rules forbade such use of the still, and young
“milk-and-blood” was told to go down to the brook, and
then come back and get the distilled water. The young man
complied, but while at the brook he was shot and killed in
full sight of the farmer.</p>

<p>The farmer grew much excited and trembled all over.
Thereafter he could not eat or sleep; he reproached himself,
although he knew he had acted quite correctly; wished he
had been in the place of this comrade; and had suicidal
thoughts. He was deeply depressed, wept easily, and showed
manual tremor. Steiner terms the farmer’s account of the
person of the deceased “reactive idealization.” After a
week there was considerable improvement. B. was sent back
to work, which he felt would be beneficial. He was put in
less dangerous surroundings, and this also had a good effect.</p>

<p>Marching and battles: Neurasthenia?</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 340.</b> (<span class="smcap">Bonhoeffer</span>, January, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A subaltern had been treated before the war for nervousness,
dizziness, and “mattigkeit” (convulsions in infancy),
but proved himself a good soldier, having gotten his rank after
the first period of practice.</p>

<p>He was in three battles in Belgium, but on the march one
day suddenly had a spell of weakness and is said to have had
convulsions. There was, however, no biting of the tongue,
and no enuresis. After a week in the field hospital, he was
sent back to Berlin where he had some somatic feelings of
anxiety without subjective disturbance or any disorders of
consciousness except a certain amount of inhibition; he was
sleepless and hypersensitive, cried easily, and was apprehensive
on being touched; he winked violently on examination
of his eyes, and while being tested for reflexes made violent
contractions of a semi-voluntary nature.</p>

<p>After four days in bed, which was a prescription hard to
carry out at first on account of the anxiety sensations, these
sensations disappeared, and at the same time the fears.
Weight began to increase; memories returned, except that
even upon recovery he could not remember that he had ever
had any true subjective feelings of fear. He was discharged
19 days later, desirous of going back into the field.</p>

<p>The peculiar absence of subjective feelings of fear in this
case is something like what Awtokratow reported from the
Russo-Japanese War, terming them neurasthenic psychoses.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> neurasthenia, Babinski believes that, by means of his
logical dismembering of the old hysteria concept, he has
shown that the exhaustion phenomena at the bottom of
neurasthenia are precisely these that cannot be cured by
suggestion. There are numerous cases in which hysteria and
neurasthenia are combined. From these combined cases,
suggestion causes the hysterical or pithiatic symptoms to be
removed.</p>

<p>English schoolmaster’s account of his war dreams.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 341.</b> (<span class="smcap">Mott</span>, February, 1918.)</h4>

<p>A sergeant, who had been a schoolmaster, was asked to
write down his dreams by Captain W. Brown, who had sometimes
charge of Mott’s cases at the Maudsley Hospital.
The first dream was as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I appeared to be resting on the roadside when a
woman (unknown) called me to see her husband’s
(a comrade) body which was about to be buried. I
went to a field in which was a pit, and near the edge
four or five dead bodies. In a hand-cart nearby was
a <i>legless body</i>, the head of which was hidden from sight
by a slab of stone. [He had seen a <i>legless body</i>, which
was covered with a mackintosh sheet, which he removed.]
On moving the stone I found the body alive,
and the head spoke to me, imploring me to see that it
was not buried. Burial party arrived, and I was myself
about to be buried with legless body when I awoke.”</p>

</div>

<p>The second dream was as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“After spending an evening with a brother (dead 11
years ago) I was making my way home when a violent
storm compelled me to take shelter in a kind of culvert,
which later turned into a quarry, situated between two
houses. Men were doing blasting operations in the
quarry, and whilst watching them I saw great upheavals
of rock, and eventually the building all around collapsed
(explosion of a mine). Amongst the débris were several
mutilated bodies, the most prominent of which was
<i>legless</i>. I tried to proceed to the body, but found that
I was myself pinned down by masonry which had fallen
on top of me. As I struggled to get free the whole
scene appeared to change to a huge fire, everything
being enveloped in flames, and through the flames I
could still see the <i>legless body</i> which now bore the <i>head
of my wife</i>, who was calling for me. I was struggling
to get free when my <i>mother</i> seemed to be coming to my
assistance, and I awoke to find the nurses and orderlies
standing over me.”</p>

</div>

<p>It appears that the patient had been shouting in his sleep,
beginning in a low voice and gradually becoming louder until
at last he was shrieking. The <i>legless body</i> occurred in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
his dreams; the sight of this had evidently produced a profound
emotional shock. He had worried a great deal about
his wife, who was much younger than himself, so that we have
this incongruous association of the <i>legless body</i> and the <i>head</i>
of his wife calling him; finally, what more natural than the
<i>mother</i> to come to his help. The emotional complex is not
incongruous in this dream, for fear is linked up with the
tender emotion.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> war dreams, see remarks under <a href="#case333">Case 333</a> concerning
oniric delirium. Roussy and Lhermitte say that emotion
and concussion are the causal factors; but in a case like 341
we have persistent war dreams of the same general nature.
Such a case as Mott’s would not be regarded as one of oniric
delirium, for the patient is not living throughout the day in
a dream, but merely has certain set dreams. The true
oniric delirium cases may lead to fugues of medicolegal importance.
Mott’s conception is that the terrifying experiences
that come to light in the dreams are repressed by the
conscious activity of the mind in the waking state. For this
process, the phrase <i>psychic trauma</i> might be used. Rows
speaks of a prolongation of mental disorder through memories
which get revived in dreams. The memories of past
and recent events pile up on one another. Elliot Smith
remarks on the number of cases in which the dreams show a
coalescence and blending of episodes alien to the war. <i>Re</i>
such combinations, see <a href="#case342">Case 342</a> of Rows, below.</p>

<p>Trench experience: War dreams, shifting to sex
dreams. Recovery on giving the patient an insight
into the nature of his dreams.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 342.</b> (<span class="smcap">Rows</span>, April, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A patient broke out of a hospital after being refused
permission to leave the grounds. He grew much depressed
and said he had been disgraced and would commit suicide
rather than bring disgrace on his family. Investigation into
this emotional outburst showed that his father had deserted
the family, that he had gotten into prison, and “tainted me.”
The patient was worried also about an idea of loss of sex
power, gathered from a book by a quack doctor, read years
ago. It appeared also that this doctor had advertised a
special bread and special medicine which would preserve the
nervous system, and that for years the patient had fed himself
and his family with the bread and medicine. When the
true state of affairs was shown to the patient, his restlessness
at night disappeared. The mental condition of this man
in fact became practically normal, and the marked tic of
facial muscles and the general tremulousness of the man
disappeared.</p>

<p>It is of note that this man’s dreams began with a terrible
incident in the trenches and then shifted to sex acts. He
woke to find the clothes disturbed.</p>

<p>This is an example of hallucinations dispelled by tracing
them to their source, and giving the patient a clear
insight into their nature.</p>

<p>According to Ballet and de Fursac, after the acute phase
of stupor and excitement with hallucinations and delirium
passes, the patient remains a depressed and psychasthenic
subject. In this psychasthenia we find inhibitory phenomena,
hyperemotionalism, and over-imagination. Amongst
the inhibitory phenomena are many of the hysterical effects.
The hyperemotionalism yields anxiety, worry, tremors, respiratory
and vasomotor disorder, dizziness, convulsions.
The third main disorder of the psychasthenic state into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
which the patient relapses is over-imagination, whereunder
we find bad dreams (bombardments, drum-beating, corpses,
attacks), somnambulistic hallucinatory episodes. It is these
hyperemotional and hyperfantastic features that distinguish
the Shell-shock syndrome from ordinary psychasthenic states.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> the sex element in this case, see remarks under preceding
case (<a href="#case341">341</a>) and also Lépine on the sex factor (<a href="#case332">Case
332</a>). Rows believes that those cases which do not recover
after a short period of rest and quiet in hospital are cases in
which there is some emotional state based upon the constant
intrusion of the memory of some past event. The physical
expression of the emotion of fear or terror may persist for a
long time quite unchanged and be proved to be due to this
old factor.</p>

<h4><b>Case 343.</b> (<span class="smcap">Rows</span>, April, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A soldier and a comrade were carrying a pail of water to
the trenches. It was very cold and they set down the pail
in order to warm their hands. The comrade placed his hand
against the man’s cheek and said, “That hand is cold.” At
that moment he was shot dead.</p>

<p>This incident was involved not only in dreams at night, but
in the daytime too, if he were quiet and closed his eyes, he
could feel the cold hand against his face.</p>

<p>He was troubled at the same time by another dream, in
which he ran down a narrow lane at the bottom of which there
was a well. He dipped his hands into the water, but on withdrawing
them, he was horrified to find they were covered
with blood. This dream was connected with a love affair,
in which a good friend interfered and angered him so much
that he attacked him when next they met. He left him on
the ground so injured that it was necessary to take him to a
hospital. The patient became anxious as to what the result
might be and left the district. He traveled, but never heard
whether his victim had died.</p>

<p>When these two dreams were traced back to their origin
they disappeared: the patient made a rapid recovery and was
able afterwards to bear a severe trial satisfactorily.</p>

<p>“During the five days spent in the village of Roeux I was
continually under our own shell fire and also continually
liable to be discovered by the enemy, who was also occupying
the village. Each night I attempted to get through his lines
without being observed, but failed. On the fourth day my
sergeant was killed at my side by a shell. On the fifth day
I was rescued by our troops while I was unconscious. During
this time I had had nothing to drink or eat, with the exception
of about a pint of water.</p>

<p>“At the present time I am subject to dreams in which I hear
these shells bursting and whistling through the air. I also
continually see my sergeant, both alive and dead, and also
my attempts to return are vividly pictured. I sometimes
have in my dreams that feeling of intense hunger and thirst
which I had in the village. When I awaken I feel as though
all strength had left me and am in a cold sweat.</p>

<p>“For a time after awaking I fail to realize where I am and
the surroundings take on the form of the ruins in which I
remained hidden for so long.</p>

seem to doze off, and there are the conflicting ideas that I am
in the hospital, and again that I am in France.</p>

find myself dozing, my mind seems to immediately begin to
fly back to France.</p>

<p>“A dream that keeps on coming up in my mind is one that
brings back a motor accident I had about six years ago, which
gave me a severe nervous shock. I had, of course, entirely
forgotten about it, except when in a motor, when I always
thought of it.</p>

had been at the front for 3½ months when he started
vomiting everything he ate.</p>

<p>He was transferred a fortnight later to a base hospital as
“gastritis.” Physical examination proved negative, but the

trench-life dreams, from which he would wake in a sweat.
He was quite unwilling to refer to these dreams.</p>

<p>In point of fact he had had to supervise the burial of many
decomposing bodies, after which he had been haunted “by
that awful smell of the dead.” Then developed states of
abstraction, in which he went over and over the burying
experience. He cried by himself.</p>

<p>It seems that the vomiting was secondary to hysterical
hallucinations.</p>

eliminated. They remark that there is no tendency to spontaneous
cure of neuropathic vomiting, and commend strict
dietetic régime and psychotherapy. They ally the condition
in its nature and genesis with so-called false or hysterical
incontinence of urine in soldiers. Wiltshire’s case early
received the diagnosis “gastritis.” It is remarkable how
little emaciation need follow such vomiting.</p>

exertions to avoid falling, whereupon he would awake with
a feeling of anxiety that would last some time. Treatment
caused the dreams to disappear.</p>

<p>There remained, however, a powerful <i>post-oniric</i> suggestion.
Any slight surprise would cause the fear of falling to reappear.
There was a sort of derived phobia, against any military act
that would need to be performed upon sudden order. He
developed a blind anger against any commanding officer who
gave a brusque order. After the crisis of anger he would fall
into tears and a feeling of profound depression coupled with

<p>A Russian lieutenant, 32, arrived at the front in November,

<p>Mentally, the patient was markedly depressed, irritable,
at times lacrimose. His complaints were of a psychasthenic

front, and was terrified at what he might do there. He feared
crowds of soldiers; he was afraid of forests and mountains;
the Germans were going to break through and capture him;
shells were about to burst over his head. He was also disturbed

hallucinations of shots and the voices of soldiers, as well as

<p>A case of hysterical astasia-abasia develops “big
belly” (“catiemophrenosis”), perhaps by hetero-suggestion
from a ward neighbor.</p>

<h4><b>Case 348.</b> (<span class="smcap">Roussy</span>, <span class="smcap">Boisseau</span> and <span class="smcap">Cornil</span>, May, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A farmer, 22, of the foot chasseurs, who had been in various
hospitals with a variety of diseases before his injury, was
evacuated June 2, 1916, for “contusion of back,” to the temporary
hospital at Bussant, from which he was evacuated to
Pontarlier for “contusion of back and cerebellar shock” and
thence, July 21, to Besançon for “internal contusion and cerebellar
shock”; thence to four other hospitals from July 31 to
February 17, 1917; finally to the Hospital at Veilpicard with
“functional disorders, paraplegia, trepidant astasia-abasia.”</p>

<p>It seems that he had lost consciousness for fifteen days and
had thereafter been paraplegic with retention of urine. The
abdomen had then increased in size in such wise as to be
termed a nervous pregnancy, <i>grossesse nerveuse</i>. The evolution
of this pseudotympanites was probably related to the presence
of the same so-called “big belly” of a patient who had been
in a neighboring bed from May, 1916, onwards. The feet were
in equine position with toes flexed, suggestive in all ways of
hysterical paraplegia. The abdomen looked like that of a
woman six months pregnant and measured 78 centimeters in
a plane passing through the anterosuperior iliac spines and
the umbilicus. The abdomen was hard, tense, swollen, and
on palpation, gave out a low, tympanic note. When the
diaphragm was mobilized progressively and slowly, the tympanites
could be made to disappear. Slow pressure on the
abdomen with flat hands effaced the swelling for the time
being; but upon release of the hands the abdomen would swell
up again as before. Pressure on the abdomen produced a
contracture of the recti. Forced flexion of thighs on pelvis
(as suggested by Denéchau and Matrais) also caused the
swelling to go down. Faradization of the phrenic nerves in
the neck caused respiratory movements with a slight diminution
in the volume of the abdomen. There was an obstinate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
constipation requiring daily lavage. Respiratory movements
were short and rapid and of the thoracic type. Abdominal
compression caused the respiration to assume almost a normal
rhythm. X-ray examination of the abdomen, after 50 grams
of bismuth carbonate had been taken in three spaced doses
the evening before, showed the intestine to be distended by
gas in such wise that the lower border of the liver became
clearly visible, as after insufflation of the stomach. The bismuth
was found in the large intestine. The splenic angle
filled with bismuth was low. On compression the splenic
angle was raised with the diaphragm.</p>

<p>The main features of this disease are the large abdomen,
simulating what has hitherto been found chiefly in females
under the name of nervous pregnancy, but also suggesting a
tuberculous peritonitis (one patient was actually evacuated
to a hospital for tuberculosis with this disease); gastro-intestinal
disorder with aerophagy, aerocoly, and obstinate constipation
(one case also showed almost daily vomiting). The
genesis of the condition appears to be a contracture of the
diaphragm in a low position of forced inspiration. The condition
may be termed a diaphragmatic neurosis.</p>

<p>Psychotherapy was applied, the patient was requested to
walk, and the movements made in walking required such an
intense respiration that the diaphragm was forced to function,
whereupon the “big belly” disappeared. The digestive disorders
then rapidly disappeared. These authors suggest the
name of <i>catiemophrenosis</i>.</p>

<p>War stress; collapse going over the top: Neurasthenia
(hereditary taint; alcoholism).</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 349.</b> (<span class="smcap">Jolly</span>, January, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A German soldier, 35, of a nervous make-up (his mother
was nervous, and he had been nervous and tremulous and
easily excitable, and alcoholic to the extent of at least 5
glasses of beer every night), was called to the colors in September,
1914. He got through his training well; in May,
1915, was on very strenuous duty in a very exposed position,
had frequently to stand up under heavy shelling, had a number
of frightful experiences, was surrounded by corpses and
mutilated bodies, and frequently took part in storming attacks.
His nervousness came to a head with some suddenness; just
as he was about to “go over the top,” he had no strength for
the effort and collapsed. Thereafter he could no longer
stand shelling, could not speak, and was inattentive to surroundings.
When he was examined by a physician he fell
asleep in his presence, although sleep had latterly been almost
impossible on account of the shelling. He was immediately
put on the hospital train and taken to the reserve
hospital in Nuremberg, where he presented an appearance of
extreme exhaustion, wept, seemed much fatigued, and trembled
all over whenever he started to do anything. He was
very easily excited and especially sensitive to noise. There
was a fine tremor of the whole body and especially of the
head; the knee-jerks were increased; there was a moderate
vasomotor reddening of the skin after stroking; his tongue
was heavily coated; but there was no other evidence of internal
disorder. His pulse was strong and not rapid.</p>

<p>The patient got well gradually, complained at first of bad
dreams, and was given to weeping. The tremors slowly
improved. The patient grew better in a hospital at home.</p>

<p>As to the diagnosis of this case, Jolly regards it as one of
nervous exhaustion. The remarkable feature is the tardiness
with which the symptoms developed under the stress of war.
Such a patient would probably never develop a neurasthenia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
under normal peace conditions. After recovery these
patients may be sent back for garrison duty or for other
work not directly connected with the firing line. As for the
tendency to desire a pension, this wish, according to Jolly,
must be strenuously opposed, both in the interest of the
state and that of the patient. If there is no will to get well,
some of these patients are found vibrating from garrison
service to furlough and to hospital.</p>

<p>The above case is one of the simplest observed; yet there
is evidence both of hereditary taint and of alcoholism. According
to Jolly, the majority of the severe exhaustion states
of a neurasthenic nature have been, in his experience, distinctly
nervous before the war, and frequently show hereditary
taint as well.</p>

<p>Series of battles: Sudden mania followed by confusion

</div>

<h4><b>Case 350.</b> (<span class="smcap">Gerver</span>, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A Russian private, looking much older than his years (35),
had been in a number of battles without mental disorder.
Where he was posted, however, there was a heavy artillery
fire in the last of the battles. Suddenly the man became
excited and leaped upon his comrades’ shoulders crying,
“The devil is here! This is hell and murder, and here are the
devil’s imps!” The commanding officer accordingly ordered
him to the rear. His regiment had suffered severe losses in
a succession of attacks upon a certain strategic height.</p>

<p>Upon evacuation to the field hospital and thence to the
interior, his excitement did not lessen. He went about with
a lost look, trembling, talking a great deal and gesticulating.
His talk was incoherent and pointless. After every few
phrases, he would repeat, “Don’t ride there! That’s hell!
Murder is being done. Devils and unholy powers are beating
and killing people.” As he said this, he would tremble,
and hands and feet would stiffen with a suggestion of catalepsy.
There was general anesthesia to pain; no response
was made to deep pin-pricks. The pupils were dilated and
failed to react, either to light or to pain. The tendon reflexes
were exaggerated. No contraction of visual fields. The man
was disoriented for time and place and much confused. No
paralysis. No wound or contusion.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> analgesia, we may only say that hysterical anesthesia
appears in a variety of forms; sometimes (<i>a</i>) in the form of
a classical stigma of hemi-anesthesia; (<i>b</i>) in a segmentary
form; again (<i>c</i>) in isolated patches; (<i>d</i>) in a very rough
way approximating the peripheral nerve distributions. Babinski
gives an unpublished note by Lasègue, in which he
states that hysterical patients not enlightened by the doctor’s
investigations do not make mention of anesthesia. But
in <a href="#case350">case 350</a> a psychotic factor may have entered.</p>

Mania with disorientation and war hallucinations.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 351.</b> (<span class="smcap">Gerver</span>, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A Russian private, 24, in a scout company, entered the
war on mobilization and took part in several battles without
reaction. May 11, 1915, he was sent with the scout party
into a hot encounter, hand to hand with machine-guns.
After the battle, the man began to yell incoherent phrases at
the men around him, started to climb over the top, and shot
off his gun without permission. He was accordingly sent to
hospital, where he was under observation for a week, during
which he had occasional flashes of excitement, jumping out
of bed and making movements of cutting or shooting, and
then in a few minutes subsiding into inactivity.</p>

<p>He was a short but well-built and well-nourished man;
the pupils responded rather weakly in accommodation; there
was a small fibrillar tremor of the face, eyes, and tongue.
The skin reflexes were diminished and there was a general
hypalgesia; considerable mechanical overexcitability of muscles;
no other neurological disorders. The mental state was
one of confusion. Although he was in one of the corps hospitals,
he said he was in a dug-out; the doctors were lieutenants;
the attendants were privates in his company. Answers
to questions were irrelevant or incoherent; there were a
number of delusional expressions. He was to be shot because
he had not himself shot enough Germans. If he were
not to be shot, anyhow the soldiers would poison him.
Rather than this he should be allowed to go into an attack.
He would take a German fort and the Czar would name him
a colonel. His regimental commander was saying to him,
“You will be a hero, you will soon get a company.” His
hallucinations sometimes included the voices of Germans
saying, in broken Russian, “We will hang you and cut your
belly open!” There was considerable amnesia for dates
and even his last battle.</p>

<h4><b>Case 352.</b> (<span class="smcap">Gerver</span>, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A Russian lieutenant, 28 (no mental disease, non-alcoholic),
was in battle August 14, 1914, on which day his
company attacked and was itself attacked several times. An
officer who observed the lieutenant said that he came to him
and informed him that the Germans must first be burned and
then fought with. Thereafter the lieutenant began to speak
loudly and incoherently, sometimes yelling incoherent orders.
He was accordingly removed from the battle-field to the hospital
back of the line. Upon examination, he was found to
be of middle height, with dilated pupils, responding weakly
to light and not at all to accommodation; twitchings of face,
eyelids, and tongue, digital tremor, marked dermatographia,
general analgesia, tendon reflexes somewhat exaggerated,
cataleptic tendency in feet and hands.</p>

<p>Mentally, the patient was in a stupor, sitting or standing
in one place, without initiative; uncomplaining but occasionally
uttering deep sighs or occasional isolated phrases. He
answered no questions or only after a long pause. He was
disoriented for time and place, but gave evidence of delusions
and hallucinations. He thought, for example, that he
was the chief of staff and had brought with him a squad of
captured Germans who were standing nearby. Some wanted
to be fed and let go; others were yelling and saying they
would burn down the house. Sometimes the patient would
hear shots and shells bursting, at which he would shudder
and turn away. Apparently he would see his comrades falling
under the shrapnel hail. However, he stood his ground
and commanded the rest of the soldiers to go forward to the
attack. Now and then he was negativistic, flexing the hands
upon request to extend them, refusing food and drink. He
was still apathetic on evacuation to the interior.</p>

<p>Shell-shock after two days in trenches: Hysterical
STUPOR seven days. Cure in three weeks,

</div>

<h4><b>Case 353.</b> (<span class="smcap">Gaupp</span>, March, 1915.)</h4>

<p>F. S., in civil life a wreath-binder in a flower shop, and
from childhood very nervous and excited, subject to frequent
nosebleeds and fainting spells (<i>e.g.</i>, at sight of blood), enlisted
at 22, November 3, 1914, as a reservist. January 18
he went into the field.</p>

<p>The wreath-binder was only two days in the trenches
before going unconscious under the whistling and exploding
shells. Physically uninjured, he was received in reserve
hospital C in a deep stupor, January 22. He was unresponsive
at first, once however saying, lost in a dream, “When
will mother come?” His gait was unsteady and he had to
be led and held. He slept a good deal in the daytime.</p>

<p>He became somewhat more active mentally, January 24
(remarking that he had slept well), and made his toilet, but
he did not yet have bearings and wanted to go to his place of
business. The next day his condition was similar. Asked
what troop he was with, he said, “In the flower business.”
January 26 he was much better, telling of the army training
and a little about the war, and wrote a postcard to his parents.
The stupor disappeared after January 27 and the
patient became mentally normal. Amnesia persisted for the
time, January 20 to 26. Headaches. February 9 he was
well, except for the limited amnesia still persisting. He was
eventually sent back to garrison duty, cured.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> stupor, Grandclaude remarks that stupor is probably
the most frequent of the mental symptoms of Shell-shock,
and that it may last from a few moments to a week. During
the stupor the patient is asthenic, stertorous, and staring.
Upon recovery from the stupor, a condition of dulness with
amnesia and disorientation ensues. There may be a third
phase of a more hyperkinetic character, with hallucinations
and delusions concerning the war. These stuporous cases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
are among the most serious of the conditions found, as some
of the victims may even suggest dementia praecox from the
persistence of childishness and silliness. As in Gaupp’s case,
Grandclaude finds that headaches and amnesia persist. Relapses
are frequent on the basis of a kind of sensitization.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> amnesia and Shell-shock, Roussy and Lhermitte speak of
amnesia as ordinarily a phenomenon of confusion. Amongst
the mental disorders of the Shell-shock psychoses, these
authors describe a group due to inhibition or diminution of
mental activity, including the rare narcolepsy, or pathological
sleep, and the confusional states proper. Simple confusion
involves slowness in thinking, and amnesia often
anterograde from the moment of the shock. Simple confusion
ought to be distinguished from so-called “obtusion”
or torpor, in which there is a disorientation for time and space,
such as was shown in Mallet’s case. Chavigny has described
an aprosexic form (with “birdlike” movements). More common
is the amnestic form of torpor. The amnesia may not
merely be anterograde from the moment of shock, but may
extend to a prolonged period prior to the accident. Sometimes
the amnesias are selective, producing phenomena of
pseudo aphasia.</p>

<p>Amnesia, monosymptomatic. Progressive recovery.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 354.</b> (<span class="smcap">Mallet</span>, January, 1917.)</h4>

<p>An infantryman, 36, arrived without information at a
psychiatric center, March 15, 1916, looking confused and
knowing little more than his name, believing himself in a
distant town. The disorientation lasted to March 21, on
which day the man recognized the doctor as such, knew that
he was at a hospital, but felt that he had just left home and
wife. From this time on, he began to pick up his surroundings,
evidently not knowing that there was a war or that he
was a soldier. He did not recognize one of his own company.
It was not until March 31 that the first memory of
the war reappeared, namely, a memory of the call to the
colors, drums, bells, and crowds. April 11 he recollected
that he was a soldier and that his wife was in the country,
where he had left her on the eleventh day of the mobilization.
In the next few days, memories came back bit by bit. He
had been at first a little thin and showed a slight fever,
oliguria, and poor digestion. All these symptoms now
lapsed, and the man became apparently perfectly well.</p>

<p>Such states, according to Mallet, are relatively frequent
in soldiers, both in epilepsy, and in infectious deliria,&mdash;more
than in the deliria of exhaustion.</p>

<p>Aviator shot down: Organic mental symptoms.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 355.</b> (<span class="smcap">MacCurdy</span>, July, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A Canadian, 20, of normal makeup, in 1915 lost part of
his left foot in a railway accident, but, notwithstanding, was
finally commissioned in the Royal Flying Corps. He enjoyed
the nine months of English training greatly. In
France he made several successful flights over the lines, but
was shot down and crashed to the ground within the British
lines after two weeks of service. He got black eyes and
bruises and lost consciousness for about four days, though a
week later he was still hazy about recent events and was not
quite sure in what hospital he lay. After another week he
arrived in a London hospital.</p>

<p>Here he would not answer questions, but stared at the
examiner, finally shouting: “I want to get up.” He said he
was in a certain suburb of Toronto, which, however, he insisted
was a part of London not far away. He wanted a
taxicab to go thither. He pondered, but seemed content
when told that Rosedale was across the ocean. A superficial
machine gun wound of the hip the patient said must be
the mark of a hospital in France; it was a secret mark,
meaning that he could return to the line and fight whenever
he wanted to and that he could use the lavatory whenever
he wanted to. He sometimes uttered brief phrases after
questioning. Asked if he dreamed, he looked up cunningly
and said, <i>e.g.</i>, “I down the Boche. I am a live wire.”</p>

<p>Next day it was clear that he had gained a good deal of
information from the nurses, and the day after he had become
oriented for time and able to recognize the physician,
though still confused about hospital names and his recent
movements. The 7 from 100 test he did slowly and made
several bad unrecognized mistakes. He was over-fatigueable,
complained of foggy eyesight, showed haziness and redness
and obscure margins in the optic discs, with the remains
of one hemorrhage, and presented nystagmus on looking to
the extreme left. Two weeks later he complained less of his
memory and said that he was beginning to remember what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
had happened during the last day of his fighting; the chase
by the German airplane and the maneuvers. He worried
about being sent back to France by a medical board, which
would not realize that he was incompetent to fly again. The
left pupil was slightly larger than the right.</p>

<p>In this case there were no neurotic symptoms and according
to MacCurdy the difficulties here are strictly those of
organic type.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> organic cases of traumatic psychosis, Lépine sums up
the subjective phenomena as follows: There is (<i>a</i>) a cephalea,
often a feeling of weight, varying at different times of the day;
often frontal; often subject to marked alteration on movement.
There may be (<i>b</i>) a number of visual phenomena like
those mentioned under <a href="#case355">Case 355</a>, part and parcel of a sort
of absence, suggesting an epileptoid effect. Sometimes (<i>c</i>)
there is vertigo, but this is rare. There are also congestive
attacks. The patients are unable to work, and have strange
head sensations when they attempt to work. The memory
disorder is not as a rule markedly accentuated. This amnesia
is usually a disordered fixation of current events, but
there is also a retrograde amnesia. Insomnia and impulsiveness
are also found, and more rarely is a depressed and
melancholy state suggesting that which <a href="#case355">Case 355</a> exhibited.
Lépine has tried to define the traumatic psychoses (not
<i>neuroses</i>) on the basis of phenomena found in trephined
cases. He remarks upon the extreme analogy, not to say
identity, between the late sequelae of trephining and the
syndrome of <i>commotio cerebri</i>.</p>

<p>A soldier lost his voice apparently from two factors: shell
fire and the emotional shock of helping to fill the big common
graves. The man could never tell for certain (retrograde
amnesia) whether he went from corpses to shell fire or from
shell fire to corpses.</p>

<p>Several weeks of daze followed in which he hardly reacted
to outward stimuli, but occasionally said “It smells!”
“Leave me still!”</p>

<p>He recovered gradually from the daze. But merely hinting

him into another daze.</p>

<p>A sapper, 21, was admitted to a base hospital semi-stuporous,
unable to answer questions and mistaking the identity
of persons about him. At first he slept, but next day found
he was in hospital. His mind was “all of a blur.” He did
not remember coming to France; “It all seems a mist.” He
felt he was ill and was afraid of becoming insane. There was
no physical sign of disease except coarse tremor of hands.</p>

<p>At intervals over a period of about half an hour, helped
by questions, he was able to get out the following with
much emotion:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Joe, don’t go&mdash;Give me my rifle, Joe&mdash;Ten killed.

<p>Between the above statements, the patient might go off

<p>Next day he was found in a condition of cheerful emotion,
saying that he was ever so much better; an orderly had
“saved him!” This orderly had taken him to the Y. M. C.
A. recreation tent, played the piano to him, and made him
play himself. His whole emotional state suddenly changed
over. He now had a good memory for everything previous
to his reaching France, and remembered simply that there
had been an explosion. He remembered two names that he
had mentioned, but he could remember nothing about their
fate in France. He did not know where they were but he
was not anxious about them.</p>

<h4><b>Case 358.</b> (<span class="smcap">Gaupp</span>, March, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A soldier, 29, a helper in a wholesale house, came to a
hospital by hospital train, uninjured, directly from the field,
having become completely deranged under shell fire. He
arrived at the clinic January 11, 1915, in deep emotion,
anxiously excited, and looking tensely and suspiciously at the
bystanders. He seemed to hear very badly and shouted his
statements like a deaf person. Led to the sick section, he
shouted out of the window, “Frenchmen!”; then he went
willingly to the bath and was put to bed, unresisting. He
lay in bed on his elbow, listening in the direction of the
window or the wall, answering loud questions with a quick,
yelling voice after a pause. He gave his name correctly.
He seemed to think he was in the trenches and to see hallucinatory
pictures of battle.</p>

<p>In the examining room he immediately sat down, back
to the wall, taking the chair at the desk and leaning it against
the wall. Asked why he did so, he said with a horrified expression,
“The shells, they are coming over! Whew! they
are shooting all the time.” He ducked, imitating the hissing
and whistling of the shells. Asked if he had been struck, he
said, “There are two dead and one’s head is off.” He declined
to be told where he was, and when he was told that he
was no longer in the enemy’s country, but in Württemberg,
he said, “No, no; they don’t come so far. No, the Frenchmen
don’t come so far.” He was very easily frightened and
started at every touch as if wakened from a dream. Sometimes
his whole body would tremble with anxiety. He
would not allow his pulse to be taken, at first. He would
suddenly shout, “That’s the Krupp now flying by. Now it
has struck.” He cast his eyes along the ceiling as if to follow
the course of the shell. Asked what he was doing, he said he
was in the trench on the mountain.</p>

<p>He was able to tell about his family, his marriage in Berlin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
and his child, and he could tell time by the clock. Then he
would suddenly shout: “The shells, they are shooting everything;
they are shooting like another earthquake.” Gaupp
stepped up to him, in uniform, and asked if the patient knew
him. He examined Gaupp suspiciously from top to toe,
looked at the shoulder-straps, and then quickly cried loudly,
“Physician.”</p>

<p>At another time he described the shell havoc with evidence
of extreme anxiety. He would take food only when one
broke off a piece and ate of it before him. He would not
drink out of ordinary drinking-glasses but only out of his
field cup, examining it carefully. He denied he was on patrol
duty at Soupis. His comrade was merely asleep just now.
A civilian physician in his long coat was termed by the
patient “a baker” after careful examination. There seemed
to be no pause in the man’s behavior, which looked absolutely
genuine and dominated by strong emotion. He had
the look of a man in immediate danger of death, exerting
himself to escape shell fire.</p>

<p>This dream-like disorder of consciousness with war delirium
persisted for a number of days. There was no marked
motor excitement. He would remain for the most part
quietly in bed, absorbed in his thoughts, watching and listening,
sometimes looking about in astonishment but not getting
his bearings. Gradually his emotions declined and he developed
a certain confidence in the nurse. She was able to
convince him that he might be in a hospital, although he
objected that there were no wounded there. (He was in a
mental section where there were no bandaged men.) All
the while he was very hard of hearing and shouted loudly in
speech. For twelve days he could not be convinced that he
was in Germany. The fact that the Sister was speaking
German was met promptly by the fact that in France the
physicians and Sisters spoke German too.</p>

<p>An extraordinary change came over him January 27
(sixteen days after admission). He went into the garden,
apparently deaf and shouting his answers, accompanied by
Sister Margarethe, whom he always called “Sister Anna”
and whom he thought came from Lichterfelde. While walking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
with the Sister, his condition suddenly disappeared. He
began to hear; he spoke in a normal tone, in fact, rather low,
and began to address the Sister by her right name, Margarethe.
He was astonished at the snow in the garden, and
asked the Sister whether she noticed that the artillery had
just stopped firing. Gradually getting his bearings, he wondered
whether he had been in the hospital since the day
before. He certainly was not ill, he thought.</p>

<p>This normal state lasted for a half hour. The patient then
relapsed into anxious semi-consciousness, becoming deaf
again and shouting his words. During the next few days
and weeks he had frequent changes of state like the above
described. The changes to a normal state would take place
spontaneously in the absence of apparent occasion, but the
relapses into semi-consciousness took place when there was
some outer irritation, especially some noise. Every fright
would cause a relapse. Once a small cannon fired at a great
distance off caused such a relapse; again, a sudden shouting
at the patient.</p>

<p>During the clear state there was a complete amnesia for
the period of illness. He did not want to believe that he
had been in the hospital for weeks, declaring that he must
have been in the trenches two days before.</p>

<p>Gradually the semi-conscious states decreased in length;
the deafness and loud speech returned with the semi-consciousness.
With the return of orientation, the man looked
entirely normal, speaking in a low voice somewhat shyly.
He was rather suspicious and could find his way about with
difficulty. His memory broke off with the last days of
December, 1914, at which time he was in the trenches under
intense shell fire. His wife had received no word from him
since December 26. Even at the beginning of February he
grew anxiously tense when the word <i>shell</i> was mentioned.</p>

<p>February 4, Gaupp presented him in clinic as entirely
clear. He mentioned that his relapses to semi-consciousness
occurred on the occasion of a loud noise or word spoken.
His face was contorted at Gaupp’s remark but there was no
other change in him. The next day, however, he told the
Sister that Gaupp had shouted out once to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span> “get him away.”
He said he had then heard artillery fire for a moment, but
pulled himself together though he had almost gone off, and
had a violent headache afterward.</p>

<p>These states of alternating normality and semi-consciousness
continued until about February 10. During a clear
spell, the patient was quiet, reserved, taciturn, a little ill-tempered
and seclusive, occasionally writing his wife a rather
empty letter. In the semi-conscious state he was emotional
and restless, seeking cover from the enemy. These states
stopped altogether about the middle of February. He then
became somewhat more open, though he had no idea of the
gravity of his condition. He was angered by the window-bars,
and offended by the opening of a letter to his wife, declaring
that he would never write a word again, as it was just
like a prison. These outbursts passed quickly by. He
wanted to go home and believed he would soon be able to go
to his comrades in the field.</p>

<p>At the time of the report, Gaupp felt that he could not be
discharged for a number of weeks. He was pallid, gave the
impression of being exhausted mentally, complained of restlessness
and internal irritation. His memory gap covered at
the end of March a period of about five weeks: from the end
of December, 1914, to the beginning of February, 1915.</p>

<p>Frostbite; thrown into water by horse; horse shot
under its rider who becomes: A HORSE IN THE
UNCONSCIOUS.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 359.</b> (<span class="smcap">Eder</span>, March, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A private in the Royal Engineers, 25, went through Gallipoli
without injury and without fears. He was sent to the
hospital in Malta, December 18. When observed by Eder,
February 7, the frostbitten finger of the right hand was well
although there was some loss of grip. He was suffering from
insomnia, terrifying dreams, shaky hands. It seems that
December 6, a horse started and he was thrown into the
water from a bridge. The next day his horse was shot under
him. A few days later, a finger was frostbitten. Then his
hands began to tremble and the insomnia set in, with severe
headaches.</p>

<p>This patient was a jovial, thickset, farmer’s son, with a
diffuse enlargement of the thyroid gland, a high blood pressure,
lymphocytosis, a fine tremor of the hands, irregular and
rapid pulse, and anginal attacks. Extremities were cold and
blue; the palms perspired markedly; there was hypersensitiveness
to sound; there were occasional attacks of dizziness,
with a feeling of suffocation; there was frequent desire
to micturate.</p>

<p>The patient’s dream was always the same: He saw a
Frenchman digging a knife into his horse, getting off a cart
to do this somewhere in Serbia. Occasionally he had this
dream in the form of a vision in the daytime. It seems that
he had actually seen a French soldier plunge a knife into a
mule to make it go. He had been busy with horses since
childhood: as stableboy and groom. He thought that the
sufferings of the mules in Gallipoli were worse than those of
human beings. According to Eder, this farmer’s son was the
horse of his dreams; instinctive fear had to emerge; he was
pitying himself. According to Eder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span> “That the person should
become a horse in the unconscious would not startle one who
has dipped into the totems and taboos of the lower races.”</p>

<p>Shell-shock; gassing; fatigue: Anesthesias.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 360.</b> (<span class="smcap">Myers</span>, March, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A stretcher-bearer, 44, eleven years in the service and two
months on French service, was seen by Lt. Col. Myers eight
days after reporting sick and admission to a base hospital.</p>

<p>While he was under cover in a cellar, three days before
reporting sick, a shell had jammed the door and the fumes
came in. Later in the day, in another cellar, he had been
blown off his seat by a shell and six other men had been laid
out. The shelling continued that day and two following
days. He had worked on the wounded without any rest.</p>

<p>On lying down he found his left arm numb and cold. The
numbness then spread to the legs, especially to the left leg.
There was continual tingling in terminal joints of fingers of
left hand; hypalgesia over both forearms and hands, especially
on left side; total analgesia over left dorsum.</p>

<p>Two days later, the patient could feel articles and reported
that the numbness occurred only in the early morning and
was followed by a tingling as the numbness passed off. On
the same day, the hands and forearms showed a total loss
of sensibility to pain, except for a small area on the flexor
surface below the elbow joint.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> spread of anesthesia and alternation of sensory symptoms
in this case. Babinski, of course, believes, that the majority
of these conditions are the product of medical suggestion, but
Babinski meets any critique by pointing out that any other
sort of suggestion may produce such results. The heterosuggestion
need not be medical. Thus, the sight of a comrade
with paralysis or anesthesia, organic or hysterical, may
suggest such to the soldier. Léri remarks that these may
also be produced by autosuggestion alone. “From a tired
feeling in a limb to a loss of power in it, there is but a small
step. Another step leads to paralysis and anesthesia. The
neuropathic temperament takes these small steps in perfectly
good faith.” Léri has found no case in which he could
exclude the influence of auto- or heterosuggestion.</p>

<p>Shell-shock; burial; somnambulistic state: Amnesia.
Recovery of memory in hypnosis.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 361.</b> (<span class="smcap">Myers</span>, February, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A healthy-looking man, with flushed face and large dark eyes
with wide pupils, complained of pains in abdomen, back, and
limbs, chiefly in knees and ankles, and of visual impairment.
This corporal said that his sight had been very indistinct
since he was buried, and that if he looked at an electric light,
he could see nothing for five minutes afterwards. He was
admitted to the Duchess of Westminster’s War Hospital at
Touquet, December 11, 1914, having been buried for 48
hours, December 8, when a shell blew in the trench where he
lay. He said he could remember nothing until he found
himself in a dressing station, lying on straw, in a barn. He
was at that time unable to see and fell over something when
he tried to walk.</p>

<p>He had gone out August 13, and had been in the last two
days at Mons and then at La Bassée. He had slept badly
and had taken a good deal of whiskey. He had led a fast
life and had had domestic worries recently.</p>

<p>It appeared that his vision had improved since the day
of the explosion; though he could read for a short time only
when things became blurred, and only with the type close to
the eyes. Bowels had not opened for five days. Vision in
right eye was 5/60; left eye, 2/60.</p>

<p>Tested for smell, he failed to smell peppermint, ether,
iodin tincture, and carbolic acid 1-40. Sugar was tasted
only after tongue movements were permitted, as was also a
strong solution of salt. Acid tasted salty like alum. The
patient complained that he did not sleep, though in point of
fact he slept well.</p>

<p>The patient was treated by suggestion, both in hypnosis
and without, when he was transferred on the 31st of December,
to the London Temperance Hospital, whence he was
discharged. The treatment by suggestion occurred daily.
At the second trial and thereafter, light hypnosis was easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
induced, but the deeper stages, with hallucinations, anesthesia,
and post-hypnotic anesthesia, could not be reached.
The lighter stages brought about sleep, a gradual restoration
of memory, and later an improvement in visual and olfactory
acuity; in near vision, in visual fields, and in color sensibility.</p>

<p>The stages in the restoration of memory are as follows:
December 22, he was able to describe how he was buried,
how Sergeant L. dug him out, how men of another regiment
than his own took him to a dressing station, whence he was
packed off by the M. O. to the dressing station of his own
regiment. Capt. S. had spoken to him and given him a
drink. Post-hypnotic suggestion caused him to remember
this latter fact after he had come out from hypnosis.</p>

<p>December 23, even before hypnosis, he could remember
a big hospital with a stove in the center of a big square room,
and gave a fragmentary account of struggling in the trench
after being buried, and of going to sleep and enjoying himself
at home, when somebody started messing him about.
In hypnosis, he gave further details of his dreams after falling
asleep in the buried state.</p>

<p>December 26, further details were remembered before
hypnosis, such as a ride in the motor ambulance, offers of
tea, cocoa, sweets, and cigarettes, a bad headache, and the
like.</p>

<p>December 27, in hypnosis, he was able to describe with
apparent accuracy the position of the trenches and their
appearance. He said:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The explosion lifted us up and dropped us again.
It seemed as if the ground underneath had been taken
away. I was lying on my right side, resting on my
right hand, when the shell came. I got my right hand
loose but my wrist was fixed behind a piece of fallen
timber. At last I dropped off to sleep and had funny
dreams of things at home. One thing in particular I
have thought of many times since, I have not been able
to make out why I should dream of the young lady
playing the piano. I don’t know her name and I don’t
think I have seen her above twice.”</p>

</div>

<p>According to Myers, it is questionable how far the patient’s
memory can be trusted; and there is considerable doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
whether the man had remained in the trench for more than
an hour after the shell had burst. A comrade said that the
doctors at the barn thought the man off his head. Another
soldier, familiar with the positions of the regiments in question,
gave information suggesting that the patient had wandered
in a somnambulistic state from the trench, past his own
dressing station to that of another regiment.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> Shell-shock and burial cases, compare remarks of
Grasset and of Foucault concerning the feeling as if dead on
the part of certain buried persons. Somnambulism is a
natural sequel to such feelings. For somnambulism, compare

<p>Shell-shock; minor injuries: Somnambulistic
“carrying on”; fatigueability, physical and mental.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 362.</b> (<span class="smcap">Donath</span>, July, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A lieutenant of infantry, 31, threw himself down on the
earth September 9, 1914, as a shell was passing over him. The
shell exploded and seriously injured a soldier one meter away.
The lieutenant got up and ran for cover about twenty meters
distant. Only six and a half hours later did he perceive that
there was a small skin lesion between his thumb and index
finger, caused by a shell fragment, as well as a superficial
burn on his right temple. Neither wound bled or had to be
dressed. He carried on, aware that they were marching
toward the River D.; but only two or three days later did
he find they had already marched to the other side of K., had
rested there and spent the night in various places in between.
During this whole period the lieutenant led his battalion and
held a piece of woods without anyone’s noticing anything
striking about him. These dazed states were twice repeated,
for periods of ten and twenty-four hours respectively, and
finally he was brought behind the firing lines unconscious.</p>

<p>The physician found him to be in a state of exhaustion,
pulse 108, and had him brought to the nearest station. There
Donath found increased tendon reflexes, some dermatographia
and increased fatigueability of mind and body. He was
especially fatigued by walking, though he had always been a
good mountain climber. He was now unable to concentrate
on reading, writing or calculating, though he had been
accustomed to dictate letters and calculations in his official
work in peace times. He had seizures of crying and trembling
on September 10 and October 27, both quieted by bromides.
There was diminution of sexual power.</p>

<p>Rest, lukewarm baths, cold compresses to the head, and
psychotherapy improved his status rapidly.</p>

<p>This patient had never been epileptic or hysterical, subject
to dazed states of any sort, was weak, delicate and anemic
(three sisters leukemic), but had before the war been well.</p>

<p>A captain, one day seeing some of his men hit by incendiary

over one of his men and succeeded in smothering the fire.
Of a sudden, he completely lost consciousness, only regaining
contact with the outer world two days later, in the sanitary
train. He did not know where he was, but thought himself
a prisoner surrounded by Germans. The disorder of consciousness
lasted three days, and the memory of what happened
during those days never returned. In fact, the
captain declared that he felt as if he had been dead during
that time. His dreamlike state lasted for some time, and for
several weeks he did not sleep without disturbing nightmares.
It was always the same night attack, with the burned men
and the anguish of feeling that his men were not about him
and that he was alone in the skirmish. He later recovered

<p>Emotions over battle scenes: Spontaneous hypnosis
or SOMNAMBULISM lasting twenty-four days.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 364.</b> (<span class="smcap">Milian</span>, January, 1915.)</h4>

<p>Upon recovery from a state of apparent hypnosis described
below, the victim wrote, in part, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“After marching two days we reached a Breton
village near Virtou. Next day we were in a battle that
lasted from seven in the morning to eight in the evening.
I was somewhat troubled by the first balls and bullets
that whistled by, but felt I had to get used to them and
we marched on, under our brave captain’s orders.
Then we really got under fire. It was sad to see my
comrades falling under the murderous bullets, and the
captain was soon mortally wounded; but we had reinforcements
and went on and chased the enemy from
his positions. During the battle I kept thinking of
my old mother and father and I felt that I should die
without seeing them again. Little things about the
family came to my mind. I saw my father’s roof, and
his favorite garden seat, and I saw my mother weeping
over her only son, her only ambition in old age. The
return from the battle was very sad for me. Night began
to fall on the frightful field. I saw on the bare
earth the bodies of poor comrades whose joys and sorrows
I had shared. There they were, cut down in all
the strength of youth, leaving their parents in trouble,
their widows in despair, and their poor orphans. I
wanted to carry them off and I could not. We had to
march over their glorious remains. I was able to give a
word of encouragement to one of my comrades who now
probably is no more. We then retired. Although I
was very weary, I was unable to get any rest. My mind
was occupied with the frightful things I had seen. I
thought of the comrades over there and that no one
could help them. I remember I drank coffee the next
morning and talked with my relative. Then that is all.
From that time I do not know what happened.”</p>

</div>

<p>The writer was an infantryman, 20, who had been employed
in civil life in the Crédit Lyonnais, and was brought August 24,
1914, to the Saint Nicolas Hospital in a state of hypnosis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span></p>

<p>Once placed in the standing position he kept balancing back
and forth, with head motionless, eyes fixed and directed to the
left side. He did not speak in reply to a request for his name
or facts about his life, but as soon as the battle was talked of he
began an expressive pantomime, speaking in a very low voice
a few words interrupted by sighs. “What were you doing in
the fight?” He extended his arms, described a half circle
with his hand, as if to show the extent of the field, thrust his
hands forward with a finger outstretched, saying, “Zi, zi,” as
if to indicate whistling bullets; plunged forward with hands
in front of his chest, as if holding a gun in charge bayonet
position, saying “Prussians, Prussians,” and threw himself
down in a kneeling posture, saying, “Trenches, trenches.”
“Do you remember the battle?” “Belgium, Belgium.
Germans pushed back,” making a sign as if chasing them.
“Captain dead. Two hundred men dead.” With a suitable
gesture he sighed, and tears ran down his face.</p>

<p>August 28 the mutism was still almost complete, but he
could say his name and lay stretched out on the bed.</p>

<p>September 4 the hypnosis was less, but the delirious state
was more active. He got up in the night and tried to escape
to help the wounded. In the daytime, if he saw a man lying
down resting he went to him and unbuttoned his coat to see
whether he was wounded. Upon seeing the physician he
would cry, “Major! Wounded! wounded!” and then pull
the physician by his coat. He could hardly be stopped from
these maneuvers. He had to be fed like a child, but went
alone to stool.</p>

<p>He began to be employed about the hospital a little
September 14, in sweeping the room and in guarding another
patient in complete somnambulism, over whom he watched
as over a child, leading him by the hand and keeping him
from bumping into objects.</p>

<p>September 16 he awoke suddenly. Some one had talked
to him about his own village and his relatives. He was astonished
to find himself in a hospital. He wrote out, on request,
the above account of his recollections. The man was 177 cm.
tall, well proportioned; showed a slight facial asymmetry and
a few other facial features of a dystrophic nature, such as an
adenoid appearance. There was no stigma of hysteria.</p>

<p>A man, 22, was brought to the Saint Nicolas Hospital in
a sort of coma August 24, 1914. He lay on the bed, eyes
closed as if asleep, insensible to excitation, irresponsive.
Flies crawled upon him with impunity. He did not wink.
The arms raised fell back inert. The corneal reflex was
absent on the left side, diminished on the right. The knee-jerks
and the skin reflexes were normal.</p>

<p>Next day he had to be fed like a child and looked after.
Lifted from bed, once on the ground he stood up with flexed
legs, as if to crouch. It seemed as if he was about to fall, but
he did not.</p>

<p>The next day he was in the same immobile state. Upon
removal from bed he again made as if to fall, but got his
balance. He kept his legs flexed, his head lowered in a fixed
posture, with his eyes on the ground. He would walk quickly
without falling, if taken by the hand, feet dragging, and even
holding back with a certain amount of force. His walk
suggested that of a somnambulist. He was left in a standing
posture by his bed throughout the medical visit. After a few
minutes he began to flex his legs progressively and slowly.
The attendant cried out, “He is going to fall.” Instead of
falling, he sat down upon the floor near the bed. He was in
the same immobile, somnolent state September 1, eyes half
open, hidden under long lashes. Flies walked over his eyes
and lids, but he did not wink. He would rise only when
pushed and walk only when pulled, but had begun to eat a
little better. To all questions he replied, from between his
teeth, “Mamma. Mamma.”</p>

<p>The next day there was a bit more spontaneity in his
walking.</p>

<p>Lumbar puncture showed a slight hypertension. There
were traces of albumin and very few lymphocytes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span></p>

<p>September 6, he was able to eat soup alone, but kept
the same immobile posture, with eyes fixed on the ground,
eyelids not winking, in a posture suggesting Parkinson’s
disease, but without rigidity. He still replied only, “Mamma.
Mamma.”</p>

<p>September 19 the patient suddenly waked up completely.
Douches and external irritations had not served to wake him
up, but a soldier told him upon this day that his brother was
not dead, as he believed, but was alive and he then began to
speak, opened his eyes, and began to talk. He told how he
had been by the side of his brother in battle. Germans had
taken them in the flank and opened machine guns upon them.
Two men had fallen by his side, and, catching at his garments,
kept him from retiring when the order was given. He got
loose, looked for his brother among the corpses, could not
find him, thought him dead, and from that point forward
had been without memory. He shortly became perfectly
normal.</p>

<h4><b>Case 366.</b> (<span class="smcap">Milian</span>, January, 1915.)</h4>

<p>An infantryman, 20, boxer by profession, was brought with
other wounded, in the night, to Saint Nicolas Hospital and
was seen next morning, August 24, in bed, lying motionless
on his back, eyes open, fixed, eyelids not winking. No reply
was got to questions. The arm lifted fell back upon the
bed, although slowly and not heavily as in apoplexy. There
was no catalepsy. The patient was taken from his bed and
put upright. In this position he remained immobile, hands
at side, head bent forward, eyes fixed on the ground. The
eyelids did not move upon approach of the finger or a lighted
candle, unless there was a fine beginning of movement. If he
was pushed, he made two or three steps forward, with eyes
fixed on the ground and head bent forward. The only
spontaneous movement was carrying the left hand back to
the side as if to take the bayonet. He got into bed alone.</p>

<p>Next day the patient could walk better and began to talk,
but preserved the same absorbed attitude. He told, in
monotonous voice, of the shells that his squad had received
and of the dead that he saw about him. August 27 he woke
up and was unable to tell how he had come to the hospital.
He told how the regiment had been bombarded for a time
and how a shell burst near him; how he got a splinter in the
buttock (of which the contusion was still visible); and how
he had been thrown down by the windage of the shell. His
sack had been torn from his shoulders. He had lost consciousness,
he thought, for a short time, anyhow he could not
find his regiment. He passed the night near Longuyon and
next day looked for his regiment again. Shrapnel burst near
him, and from that time forward he had lost memory. August
27, at his express request, he started back for his corps.
There was no stigma of degeneration or hysteria.</p>

brother epileptic) was buried by a shell explosion and overcome
by gas. After a month’s leave he went back to the
trenches.</p>

<p>But now, whenever a shell burst, he fell into irresistible
terror and made convulsive movements which he forgot afterwards.
He could not sleep. The mere memory of the scene
would throw him into terror. He was tremulous, developed
asymmetrical innervation of his face, was generally hypesthetic
and mentally blocked.</p>

<p>In the midst of convulsive tremors he fled towards the
enemy. He was stopped and brought back, and remained
for two days confused and hallucinated.</p>

oniric delirium to mental confusion is still a matter of polemic.
According to Régis, however, the common oniric delirium of
toxic or infectious origin is nothing more than a sort of
somnambulism. The retrograde amnesia which follows toxic
delirium is the same in principle as that which follows
hysterical delirium. Régis pointed out that suggestive hypnosis
could bring back the memories in both types of disease,
as well as from the toxic delirium as from the hysterical somnambulism.
However, the differential diagnosis between
onirism and hysteria is not easy. Alcoholism and actual
brain trauma need to be excluded.</p>

<p>Shell-shock; windage; unconsciousness: Carried
on with fugue tendencies. Variety of hysterical
symptoms. Fit for garrison duty four months from
explosion.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 368.</b> (<span class="smcap">Binswanger</span>, July, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A non-commissioned officer, 22, entered service at 20, went
into the artillery and had been advanced repeatedly. There
was no heredity; the man had been a moderately good
scholar. It appears that he had had at 17 a febrile angina
with delirium.</p>

<p>September 25, 1914, a big shell load for a cannon was
exploded by the enemy. All the men about the cannon were
thrown to the ground by air pressure, and the officer became
unconscious. On awaking, he had headache, dizziness, and
vomiting. There were many corpses lying about him.</p>

<p>He resumed work at once, but in the evening his headache
and dizziness increased and there was “a feeling inside as if
he had to run away.” This feeling appeared to come from
the heart; it was an oppressive feeling, running to the head.
On the next day he did gun duty, noticing, however, that
every shot he fired caused him a sharp pain. He was relieved
from work at 11 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span>, and was declared ill by the physician.
His comrades told him that he had often been noticed trying
to run away, but about this he himself declared he knew
nothing.</p>

<p>He was received at the Jena Hospital, October 9, 1914, a
very strongly built and well-nourished man. Neurologically,
he showed a marked dermatographia; knee-jerks were
obtainable only on reinforcement; Achilles jerks somewhat
more marked; there was a weakly positive Oppenheim reflex.
The abdominal reflex on the left side was greater than that
on the right; and this was also true of the cremaster reflex.
Percussion of the head was extremely painful; and there were
painful points on pressure of the spine and head.</p>

<p>Touch was poor on the entire left side of the body; but
there was no diminution of sensibility to pain. There was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
a fine static tremor of the hands. The strength of both
hands appeared to be decreased (dynamometer). Gait was
unsteady and stiff; Romberg sign was positive; the patient
fell over backward. Hearing was greatly diminished, ordinary
speech being heard only close to the ear.</p>

<p>Toward evening of the second day after admission, there
was a marked attack of dizziness while the patient was lying
on his back in bed. During this attack the face was very
red. It lasted two or three minutes. Hearing was remarkably
improved on the left side for some time after the attack.
The ear clinic examination, October 19, showed much disturbance
of hearing on the right side (direct injury of the
vestibular apparatus in both ears).</p>

<p>Headaches continued, radiating from the orbit to the top
of the head, and sensitiveness to pressure at the exit point
of the upper branch of the right trigeminal. The whole of
the forehead was somewhat red and swollen (neuralgia of the
frontalis). The patient wore dark goggles on account of his
marked photophobia.</p>

<p>Improvement was gradual; there was a transient slight
swelling and a venous hyperemia of the nasal mucosa, which
was treated in the nose clinic. The impairment of hearing
was quite gone in two months’ time, though buzzing was now
and then heard in the right ear. The supersensitiveness in
the right upper trigeminal region vanished also. The patient
was discharged January 21, 1915, fit for garrison duty.
Later he went into the field again.</p>

<p>Burial: Dissociation of personality.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 369.</b> (<span class="smcap">Feiling</span>, July, 1915.)</h4>

<p>The following are some stories told by a “lost personality”
under hypnosis.</p>

<p>The patient, aged 24, was a bandsman in the Second
Battalion Wiltshire Regiment, who sometime near the end
of October 1914, was buried in a trench near Ypres. This
is his account:</p>

<p>“I was dug out at night and taken to a dressing station; it
was cold and dark. Then I went on to a hospital at Ypres;
it was really a convent, and there were a lot of nuns about,
dressed in dark robes with white hats; some of them spoke
English. I stopped there for a night and a day. There were
a lot of wounded there. Then I was sent on by train; I lay
down all the way on a seat in the carriage; we took the
whole day to get to &mdash;&mdash;, and kept on stopping at stations.
I was at &mdash;&mdash; about ten days; I don’t know what hospital
it was, but there were English doctors and nurses. It was
near the harbor. We came over to England in a hospital
ship, the <i>Arethusa</i>; I went straight on to Manchester by
train. The hospital there was really a school turned into a
hospital.”</p>

<p>Here is a brief account of a scrap with some Uhlans.</p>

<p>Q. Did you see any Uhlans? Yes.</p>

<p>Q. What are they like? They’ve got no guts. One time
30 of them were against 8 of us infantry, and they “done a
bunk.” Their horses were not bad. They wore helmets
with a double eagle on the front.</p>

<p>He was asked to describe the country round the trenches
and to give some account of the fighting there:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span></p>
<p>“It’s agricultural land, ploughed fields. There were two
farms in front of us. One day we saw an old cow between
our trenches and the Germans, and we all had pot shots at it.
Once the Germans rushed our trenches; we killed hundreds,
bayoneted them mostly, and hit them over the heads with
the butts of our rifles. It was hellish. The British were all
shouting. I saw a German officer behind with a sword and
a revolver. I saw a lot of French soldiers, too; they wore
long coats with the corners turned back; some had blue and
some had red trousers. The French dragoons are like Life
Guards, with big steel breastplates and brass helmets with
a long plume; they carried swords and rifles and a few had
lances.”</p>

<p>He was asked to mention some of his impressions in Belgium
and what he thought of the manners and customs of the
French and Belgians.</p>

<p>“We cut off all our buttons and gave them to the French
girls. The French cigarettes are muck; you buy them in
little blue packets; the tobacco is rather dark and strong.
When we bivouacked on the march at night we were not
allowed any lights, but you could smoke by digging a hole in
the ground with your bayonet and smoking into that.”</p>

<p>The following are some of his remarks about his stay at
Gibraltar.</p>

<p>“Gibraltar’s like a great big rock; the steep side looks
toward Spain. I was in barracks there, and used to spend a
lot of time in the band-room practicing. Sometimes we
bathed in the sea. I went to Spain two or three times and
saw some bull-fights; they were very exciting, but rather too
cruel for my taste. They used to kill six or seven bulls a
day. The horses got fearfully cut about.”</p>

<p>This bandsman showed what Feiling calls dissociation of
personality. There was an amnesia of such degree that all
conscious memories of the patient’s life, as well as all memory
of letters, objects, and life in general, were suppressed. The
patient was brought, after the burial above noted, to the
hospital for epilepsy and paralysis at Maida Vale, January 21,
1915. After his experience, he had been transferred to the
Second Western General Hospital, Manchester, where he
spoke sensibly, understood and was able to remember things
since the burial. His mind was a complete blank for all
previous experience. He was unable to recognize his own
father or relatives. He was slightly deaf for a time but this
defect disappeared.</p>

<p>At Maida Vale he showed a nervous twitching of eyelids
and facial muscles; otherwise he was neurologically and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
physically normal, dreamless, without complaints, and
straightforward about all experiences since coming to himself
in the hospital at Manchester. He took his parents on trust.
“I don’t know if I ever went to school.” “A bayonet is like
a knife; you see soldiers with them on their rifles. I have
never seen a bullet.” His memory for recent events was also
not good. He once recognized a single tune played at a
concert.</p>

<p>Suspected of malingering, he was tried out in various ways.
He was told that an elephant was a little furry animal and
shown a little 6 inch toy sample. On going to the zoo he was
greatly astonished at seeing a real elephant. He did not
know what the war was about and he had no interest therein.</p>

<p>March 10 he was hypnotized and proved an easy subject.
Powerful suggestions that lost memories would return were
unavailing. The next day, during hypnosis, it was found
that his previous experience could be readily tapped, and a
history of his family, schooling, running away, and eventual
enlistment was told. He had been at Gibraltar when war
broke out. He was at the first battle at Ypres, and was for
ten days in severe trench fighting, and was finally buried in
the mud and débris of a trench blown in by a high explosive
shell. He had been buried for about 12 hours, was dug out
at night, and (according to his father) remained unconscious
24 hours, and deaf and dumb three days. He was transferred
to another hospital and then to Manchester, where he
came to himself.</p>

<p>Only during the first few sittings did the patient lie with
eyes closed. Later, during hypnosis, he behaved exactly like
a normal person. The fact came to light that when hypnotized
the patient returned to the personality that possessed
him just before awakening in Manchester, and accordingly
during hypnosis, he had to become acquainted again with his
hypnotizer. Maida Vale astonished him, as it should have
been Manchester. Thus there were two personalities: No. 1:
The personality since the date of the Manchester awakening;
No. 2: The personality containing all the memories of the
past life as well as the more recent Flanders memories. In
State No. 1, the manner was jaunty and cocksure. In State<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
No. 2, the man was more modest and less loud. Moreover,
though in State No. 1 he spoke with a Lancashire accent, in
State No. 2 his speech was in the West Country dialect&mdash;a
strange observation, confirmed by several observers. He
was asked to write down the answers to questions, and on
awakening from hypnosis was shown the things written;
whereupon he laughed and said, “Why, that’s not my
writing.” On writing out the same sentences again, various
minor points of difference were apparent. Hypnotized in
the presence of his father, in whom in State No. 1 he took no
great interest, he showed every sign of joy, causing his father
to think that in State No. 2, his son had “come all right
again.” In State No. 2 he could play a euphonium better
than in State No. 1; but after practicing in State No. 1 he
rapidly became as expert as in the hypnotic state.</p>

<p>If the patient were left for some time before being awaked
by a previously-arranged method of counting three, he would
experience disturbed dreams, with clenched hands, snarling
lips, and muttered phrases, “Give it them,” etc.</p>

<p>Twenty-five hypnotic sittings were given but no improvement
took place and the patient was discharged May 5.
May 25 there had been no further change and he remained
in State No. 1, in which state he was invalided from the
service by a medical board, May 28.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="case370">
<p>Ear complications and hysteria.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 370.</b> (<span class="smcap">Buscaino and Coppola</span>, 1916.)</h4>

<p>An infantryman, 22 (father and mother quite normal;
patient showed slight convulsions, attributed to worms, from
which he actually suffered; was malarial from 9 to 15; had
otitis media and lost hearing completely at 11; had suffered
from 9 onwards with joint pains; as an adult had no convulsions),
was called to arms August, 1914, and sent to the
front May 2, 1915. About the end of August, in a water-filled
trench by Monte San Michele, he was covered with mud from
a shell explosion, lost consciousness, and in some way got
back to the second line. He was told that blood had flowed
from the right ear, and on recovery he found himself unable
to hear with that ear, although it was the left in which he
had had otitis. There were continual noises in the ear. He
was, however, sent back to the front line. By mistake, one
day, he got with companions in the midst of the enemy’s
barbed wire, saw sparks from the guns, heard no shots, saw
comrades fall, and threw himself instinctively into the wire
network. Leaving the food kettles, he finally got back to
the trenches. He was sent to the hospital at Legnano for
his ear pains, and was treated by leeches, which he could not
feel. He began to hear a little more. Flies walked on the
left cheek without being felt. This anesthesia had begun a
few days after the shell explosion. He was transferred to a
military hospital at Florence.</p>

<p>One day he wedged a toothpick in cotton into his left ear
and was charged with simulation, though he had been absolutely
deaf in his left ear since childhood. From the moment
the military surgeon told him he would be denounced for
simulation, he lost his memory. Reports indicate that he
had headache and delirious dreams (October 30), and suddenly
he became furious (October 31), about three hours
later going into severe collapse, for which camphor injections
were given.</p>

<p>November 1 he had battle dreams and lumbar puncture
had to be given up as he was in the midst of an attack. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
hypodermic injection was interpreted by the patient as a
wound, and he cried as if he were being abandoned on the
battle-field. At one point he woke up from his hallucination
and asked where he was and shortly relapsed into stupor.
November 2, the patient was slightly bewildered and felt
pains where the lumbar puncture needle had been tried the
previous day. November 5, he was disoriented, thinking
himself still at Legnano. The pupils were throughout dilated.
November 6, confused and dreamy; November 7,
he soiled his bed, was somewhat disoriented, immediately
corrected himself; oculo-cardiac reflex 64 full compression,
62 during compression. November 11, headache; November
12, a slight bewilderment reappeared; November 13,
remembered for the first time having been stunned by shell
explosion, and this day got up and wrote home. November
14, complained of pains in muscles and weariness. Pupils
still dilated. November 16, pulse 86; a gradual increase
from 50 to 60 during previous days. November 17, patient
had begun to remember facts that preceded the dream syndrome.
November 18, pulse standing 88; November 20,
pulse standing 120. This day cried when he remembered
having been suspected of simulation. November 22 and 23,
aches in joints and intense otalgia; pulse 86. November
24, diarrhea; deafness somewhat diminished; 26, diarrhea;
looked as if he were about to have a new hallucinatory
episode. This, however, did not come about until December
1, when he heard cannonading and knew the regiment was
near. Next day he had forgotten the cannonading. December
14, the patient had become entirely tranquil and lucid
and was able to give his entire history. December 16 and
17 he was given a systematic neurological examination, which
showed on the left side complete anesthesia, hyperesthesia
to pressure, thermanesthesia, analgesia, loss of bone, tendon,
and muscle sensation. Vision was diminished more on the
right side than on the left, and the visual fields on this side
were more contracted. During examination, the fields became
still more tubular. There was complete deafness,
anosmia, and ageusia on the left side. On the right side
there was a slight diminution of hearing. The pharyngeal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
reflex was abolished; the cremasteric reflex was somewhat
less on the left than the right; and the defensor reflexes of
the left leg were less marked than those of the right. There
was no clonus or Babinski. The dynamometer grasp on the
right was 37; on the left 18; and on this side there was a
limitation of voluntary movements.</p>

<p>In the course of our study of psychoses incidental in the
war (<a href="#A_PSYCHOSES_INCIDENTAL_IN_THE_WAR">Section A</a>) and especially of Shell-shock’s nature and
causes (<a href="#B_SHELL-SHOCK_NATURE_AND_CAUSES">Section B</a>), we have naturally met most if not all of
the major diagnostic difficulties. In the present Section we
shall study cases for the light they may throw on the more
technical troubles of the diagnostician. Who would <i>à priori</i>
have felt that such diseases as tetanus, rabies, malaria, would
produce practical difficulties in clinical diagnosis in the field
of Shell-shock?</p>

<p>Mayhap there was no need to emphasize further the values
of lumbar puncture fluid examination. Yet the admixture of
“functional” and “organic” symptoms in numerous puzzling
cases can hardly be over-emphasized.</p>

<p>But the interpolation, through the ingenious inquiries of
Babinski, of a new or but vaguely suspected series of “reflex”
(“physiopathic”) troubles between the organic neuropathic
disorders on the one hand and the hysterical psychopathic
disorders on the other&mdash;the result of these
observations, sampled only in <a href="#B_SHELL-SHOCK_NATURE_AND_CAUSES">Section B</a>, is given more in
detail in the present Section. What a split in therapeutic
method a recognition of this new group of “physiopathic”
disorders might entail is seen also in further cases in the

<p>Value of lumbar puncture.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 371.</b> (<span class="smcap">Souques</span> and <span class="smcap">Donnet</span>, October, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A colonial soldier arrived at Paul-Brousse Hospital with
a hospital ticket showing that ten days before he had had
<i>commotio cerebri</i>. He was dull, had a fixed stare, held his
head in his hands, was disoriented for time and place, and
had lost memory for everything that had happened for
eighteen months. There was no sign of wound. There was
no motor disorder save that walking was a bit slow and
uncertain. Perhaps the right knee-jerk was stronger than
the left. Percussion of the right Achilles tendon produced
tremor. The plantar reflexes were flexor on both sides;
flexion lasted longer right than left. The cremasteric and
abdominal reflexes were a little weaker on the right. Arm
reflexes were lively. Sensations proved normal. Complaint
of headache, frontal and vertical.</p>

<p>Lumbar puncture October 7, that is, on the thirteenth
day after the shell-shock, yielded a transparent, slightly
greenish fluid, with 92 cells per cm. (lymphocytes with one
or two large mononuclear cells and a few sometimes degenerated
endothelial cells) and hyperalbuminosis.</p>

<p>October 9, the clouding of consciousness was less marked.
The headaches and amnesia were constantly complained of;
the reflexes were normal. October 12, there was less headache.
October 25, another lumbar puncture showed but 14
or 15 lymphocytes per cm. and hyperalbuminosis. There
was now no longer any clouding of consciousness. The
amnesia, retrograde and anterograde back to May 9, 1914
(date of his daughter’s birth), and up to September 25, 1915,

war, or the mobilization, or his regiment, and the like.

<p>Meningeal and intraspinal hemorrhage: Lumbar
puncture.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 372.</b> (<span class="smcap">Guillain</span>, May, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A gunner from Morocco, who lost consciousness for an
hour March 28, 1915, upon the explosion of a large-calibre
shell in his trench, was carried to the ambulance. He
complained of headache and generalized pains. His status
was scarcely modified during five weeks, and a generalized
contracture of the body developed whenever movements
were attempted. In horizontal decubitus, the muscles of the
limbs and neck were of a normal tonicity, but the head went
into hyperflexion if the patient was asked to sit. The eyes
turned upward, and Kernig’s sign developed. The patient
could walk only with short steps, with legs apart and arms
held away from the body, the head in a sort of tetanoid
dorsal hyperflexion. There was a right-sided hemiparesis
with trepidation and the Babinski sign.</p>

<p>Lumbar puncture assured the diagnosis of something
organic. The fluid contained blood cells and a marked
lymphocytosis. The symptoms evidently depended upon
hemorrhages in the meninges and the nervous system, affecting
particularly the right pyramidal tract.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> hypothesis of organic changes in hysterical cases,
Roussy and Lhermitte remark in comment upon albuminosis
in the cerebrospinal fluid that the albumin is perhaps
due (in cases of camptocormia) to the effect upon venous and
lymphatic circulation of the spinal curvature. It was Sicard’s
claim that camptocormia, or bent back, was due possibly to
anatomical changes in the spinal column, that is, that camptocormia
was in one sense a spondylitis. In other cases the
camptocormia might be due to a ligamentous or muscular
change; that is, to a syndesmitis or a psoitis. His idea was
that the curvature was in a sense antalgic; that is, a response
having the purpose of avoiding pain.</p>

<p>Slight hyperalbuminosis.</p>

<h4><b>Case 373.</b> (<span class="smcap">Ravaut</span>, August, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A farmer, 32, in the 66th Infantry, was lying in a dug-out
March 5, 1915, when a bomb threw him on the ground
and covered him with earth. He was picked up unconscious,
and remained so for an hour. In the ambulance
it was found that he could hardly stand, could not speak,
and appeared to be completely confused. There was no sign
of wound. The next day he recovered consciousness and
complained of a violent headache. He was completely deaf
in the left ear, and vision was also a little impaired on that
side. The puncture fluid was clear, and there was a very
slight excess of albumin by the heat test. The next day the
headache had entirely disappeared, the left ear was absolutely
deaf, but the patient complained of buzzing. Lumbar
puncture the following day showed a normal amount of
albumin.</p>

<p>March 16 the patient was evacuated to the rear presenting
no abnormal symptom except deafness.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> the spinal fluid, Armstrong-Jones considers that a
shock directly sustained by the spinal apparatus through
sudden impact to the surrounding cerebrospinal fluid, ought
to be felt more by the anterior horn cells than by the spinal
root ganglia, since the latter are shielded by the sheath in
the intervertebral spaces. Motor symptoms would, naturally,
then be more frequent than sensory symptoms. He
also believes that the controlling neurones in the intermedio-lateral
tracts that have to do with the sympathetic system,
would be affected just as anterior horn cells are. Accordingly,
the dilated pupils, rapid heart, dyspnoea, and a variety of
precordial pains and disorder of the viscera would ensue.
The jar would thus be communicated to the neuronic cells
of origin of two types: spinomuscular and preganglionic,
leaving the gangliospinal neurones relatively intact.</p>

<p>Paraplegia, organic: Lumbar puncture.</p>

<h4><b>Case 374.</b> (<span class="smcap">Joubert</span>, October, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A gunner, 23, was thrown to the ground, according to his
story, by the explosion of a large-calibre shell, at eight o’clock
in the morning of September 10, 1914. He could not get up
but thought he had not lost consciousness. September 13,
he arrived at hospital, looking like a man with dorsolumbar
fracture of the spine. There was, however, no external injury.
There was a marked paresis of the right upper extremity,
with diminished sensibility, weakened reflexes, numbness,
formication. The right lower extremity was subject to complete
flaccid paralysis, with lost reflexes, and anesthesia in all
respects reached to the belt level, and stopped sharply at the
median line of the abdomen. The left leg, also, was paretic
but the muscles could be contracted weakly; the knee-jerk
was exaggerated; there was a tendency to epileptoid trepidation,
and the sensations were only slightly diminished.
There was a Babinski reflex on the right side; the abdominal
reflex was absent on the left side; both cremasteric reflexes
were present. The feet at times gave formication. Rectal,
bladder, and sphincter paralysis. Dark albuminous urine,
with a few blood cells, was obtained on catheterization.
There was an early sacral decubitus; consciousness was
somewhat clouded. The man made no requests except for
something to drink, and seemed apathetic.</p>

<p>Lumbar puncture, September 14, yielded hemorrhagic fluid.
Three days later, the upper extremity regained its powers
and sensations, but the paraplegia had become complete,
with abolition of reflexes on both sides, and absolute anesthesia.
The feet yielded formication at times, however.
Sacral decubitus increased and healed not. The temperature
varied between 38 and 39. The patient died September
24, in coma, with anuria and Cheyne-Stokes breathing.</p>

<h4><b>Case 375.</b> (<span class="smcap">Claude</span> and <span class="smcap">Lhermitte</span>, July, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A soldier, 22, sustained a gunshot wound in the neck
about the level of the fourth cervical vertebra. He immediately
became quadriplegic. He recovered arm motion in
two months and some weeks later ability to stand and walk.</p>

<p>Three months after the injury, station was difficult, better
on a broad base. Rombergism, even with eyes open. Cerebellospasmodic
gait. There was no weakness of leg muscles,
but there was a certain degree of weakness of the upper extremities,
especially in finger flexion. There was hypertonia
of the muscles of all the extremities and the hands showed
the signs of Raimiste, of Klippel and Weil, and of Dejerine.
Static equilibrium was preserved to the will, but the kinetic
balance was affected, and as much in the upper as in the
lower extremities. Ataxia, tremors, dysmetria, adiadocho-kinesia,
and disorder of combined movements in thigh and
trunk flexion were all in evidence. Meantime, there was no
disorder of sensation whatever except that the ulnar border
of the right hand showed a hypobaresthesia, and there was a
disturbance of tactile discrimination and absolute astereognosis
in the hands. The deep reflexes were everywhere increased,
and ankle and patellar clonus were easy to excite,
especially on the right side. Bilateral defense reflexes. Bilateral
Babinski sign. The hypertonia and ataxia ebbed
away during the following three months. Walking became
normal, and there was little sign of difficulty except astereognosis
of both hands, combined with slight disturbance of
deep sensibility and poor response to compass test in palm.</p>

<p>We here deal with a case of spinal column injury without
injury to the dura mater. This cerebellospasmodic form of
the superior cervical type of spinal concussion is less frequent
than a quadriplegic form with Brown-Séquard syndrome. It
is striking that both types of concussion may recover.</p>

<p>A musketeer, wounded August 20, 1914, by a shell splinter
in right side of vertebral column, fell unconscious, but was
able afterward to crawl on all-fours out of the firing line.
Severe vomiting and epistaxis followed. August 23, there
was pain in the small of the back; the last two ribs were
painful on right side; and the muscles were slightly swollen
up to the iliac crest. August 30, a slight rise of temperature
(at first it had been above 38) still persisted, but the
muscular swelling was diminished. Treatment by aspirin
and baths. No further rise of temperature after early in
September.</p>

<p>On October 9, patient was permitted to get up, whereupon
he showed a peculiar curved attitude of the body, reduced
almost completely by passive straightening. Swelling of the

process. Pains in left lumbar region.</p>

<p>November 19, on examination, pulse 112. November 23,

<p>On admission to the nerve hospital December 22, the musketeer
was unable to extend the trunk, and the long muscles
of the back were on the stretch, often as hard as wood,
especially those of the left (longissimus dorsi). Patient lay
on right half of pelvis. Hemianesthesia and hemianalgesia,
left side. Tachycardia. Formerly the patient had done
hard work, especially carrying heavy bags. He declined to
be examined under general anesthesia. He seemed to be
of unreliable character, and his trouble did not prevent him
from returning from leave of absence, on one occasion, drunk.</p>

<h4><b>Case 377.</b> (<span class="smcap">Dupouy</span>, September, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A lieutenant, 23, was in a mine explosion June 23, coming
out in complete torpor, with mutism and retention of urine.
He was brought to hospital June 26, with jactitation, irregular
pulse, markedly exaggerated tendon reflexes, absent skin
reflexes, sluggish, dilated pupils, especially right, and general
anesthesia. The spinal fluid contained an excess of albumin,
altered blood cells and many lymphocytes.</p>

<p>Several hours after puncture he suddenly demanded where
he was, thought it was the year 1911 when he was in the
Dragoons, talked about his camp, and was confused, irritable
and stereotyped in questions. There was no verbal amnesia.
Speech was hesitant, explosive and scanning, suggestive of
multiple sclerosis. Next day there was still retrograde
amnesia. He clung to the belief that it was July, 1911,
and asked wearisome, stereotyped questions. The words,
“German house” caused a jactitation, stiffening and relapse
into a <i>second état</i>, out of which he came with hiccoughs and
sighs, and amnestic for this conversation. There was general
hypesthesia and muscular weakness especially of legs. The
reflexes were as before.</p>

<p>The morning of June 28, he heard the hum of an airplane,
whereupon his memory returned. It seems that he had himself
once ascended. The memory gap was now limited to the
time immediately preceding the mine explosion and the days
following, up to the time of hearing the airplane. He told
about his military life and also about incidents immediately
preceding his blowing up. He complained of malaise and of
pains in the vertebral column and limbs.</p>

<p>There was a quadriparesis, more marked, however, on the
left; walking with falls to the left; astasia with left foot;
double facial paresis; inability to whistle and to close eyes
completely; intestinal and bladder paralysis; nocturnal
emissions non-pleasurable; partial anesthesia of right leg, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
arm and of hand, with hyperesthesia of thigh, of forearm and
of the posterior aspect of the upper arm; anesthesia of the
left side, including thorax and abdomen, excepting that the
arm was hypesthetic only. Face hyperesthetic. Complete
anesthesia of nipple and testis; hypesthesia of neck;
anesthesia of tongue, nose and vertex; plantar, cremasteric,
abdominal reflexes absent; exaggerated tendon reflexes;
pupil reflexes normal; painful heat flashes and profuse sweating
on the slightest movement; vertigo and tendencies to
syncope after effort; explosive, scanning speech; intermittent
convulsive movements of the arms. Palpation and
X-ray show separation of the spinous processes of the third
cervical vertebra.</p>

<p>Improvement was marked and progressive in motor, sensory
and reflex fields. At the time of report three months
later, there was a definite paresis of the left leg, with anesthesia
and absent plantar reflexes, and slight paresis of the
orbicularis palpebrarum, scanning speech and syncopal tendencies.
Here, then, due to diffuse, non-systematic lesions,
with superadded hysterical manifestations, were probably
some effects of a permanent nature due to destructive

<h4><b>Case 378.</b> (<span class="smcap">Hurst</span>, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A champion heavy-weight boxer, 29, was unconscious for
two days after being knocked over by the explosion of a shell
in December, 1914. He found at first that he could not
move the right arm or left leg; and after power had returned
to the limbs, he had forcible involuntary movements in the
left leg whenever he tried to stand. Examined, April 1,
1915, he answered questions slowly and with slow words;
the right arm was weak. When the left hand was clenched,
an associated movement took place in the right hand, but not
vice versa. There was, however, no diminution in the girth
of the muscles. The man was unable to localize light tactile
stimuli accurately. Movements of the left leg were somewhat
weak, the left knee-jerk was slightly brisker than the
right; ankle clonus could be obtained on the left side and
Babinski second sign (paralyzed leg rising higher than the
normal leg in combined flexion of thigh and pelvis). When
the man tried to walk, the left leg moved rapidly from side to
side round the point of contact of the toes. When the right
leg moved forward, the left dragged behind in irregular
movement.</p>

<p>Every effort to cure the patient by means of suggestion
during hospital care for a month entirely failed. Although
the man was easily hypnotizable, he could not be made to
move his leg under the deepest hypnosis. The first whiff of
ether hypnotized him, so that the method of etherization
could not be used in the endeavor to control the leg movements.
Over a year later, July, 1916, the patient had greatly
improved mentally but was otherwise in precisely the condition
that is above described.</p>

<p>November 3, numerous small furuncles appeared on the

high temperature, between 38 and 40; but January 3 the

At this time he was able to pass urine unaided, though with
tenesmus and pain, sometimes nausea and a tendency to
vomit. He complained of pain in the back and pelvic region;
the legs lay as if paralyzed. No active movement whatever
was performed. There was a marked increase of tendon
reflexes (even including the semi-membranosus). The muscles
were relaxed through disuse but there was no atrophy.
The patient moved his legs about with his hands. Sensibility
was preserved except in the region of the pubis. The
plantar reflexes were absent. Electrical reactions normal.</p>

<p>The diagnosis was functional paralysis of the legs (previous
gunshot injury of cauda equina).</p>

<p>Treatment with psychotherapy met with prompt results;
within a few days, the patient learned to move his legs and
to walk with support, though making enormous efforts which

remained “Shell-shock” until February, 1916, then being able
to walk five or six miles on smooth ground. Going downstairs
he took the step with left foot rather than with right, and the
right was apt to turn in. The sense of position and movement
in regard to the right foot proved to be faulty. He
could not balance himself on the right foot, nor could he
appreciate tuning fork vibrations as well on this foot as on
the other.</p>

<p>An X-ray examination showed a slight fracture, without
deformity, in the left post-Rolandic region near the median

ambulance, unable to speak, and next day had a confusional
crisis of convulsions with contractures. He had not urinated
since the accident, and two liters of clear urine were withdrawn
by catheter; after which, the patient rested quietly
and gradually regained consciousness. He was catheterized
again in the evening and clear urine withdrawn. He remained
unable to urinate spontaneously until December 25,
and was catheterized accordingly.</p>

<p>There was no motor, sensory, or reflex disorder in this
patient. Lumbar puncture yielded a normal fluid; the
pupils were normal, and the only appearance was that of a
marked asthenia.</p>

five hundred meters without a certain trembling of the legs.

was supposed to be able to produce anuria as well as albuminuria,
and even such organic changes as vesicles of the skin,
ulceration, hemorrhages in the skin or of the viscera, fever,
and even gangrene. He remarks that of late years no single
identifiable case of this sort proved to be hysterical, has been
reported. This is aside, of course, from such superficial and
quickly passing vasomotor disorders as erythema and dermatographia.
Anuria and albuminuria have consequently
passed from the textbooks on hysteria, just as Babinski
believes that hysterical edema and hysterical exaggeration
of the reflexes are bound to pass. Hysteria cannot imitate
everything; it cannot reproduce the characteristic phenomena
of organic paralysis.</p>

yielded a clear fluid under normal pressure, but with an excess
of albumin. For three days, retention of urine was

small of the back while lying in the firing position, about
2 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span> August 22, 1914, at Eth in Belgium. He felt as if he
had been struck by the butt of a gun in the lumbar region.
He was unable to get back with his comrades. His sack had
been cut. He was without ammunition, and getting to a
bridge he was able to jump a distance of about 8 meters. He
fell and fainted. On coming to himself, his left side felt bad
and he could not move his left leg. He dragged himself to
the relief post which was being bombarded just as he arrived,
and he got a bullet in the left frontal region.</p>

<p>He was evacuated to another ambulance and decided to
go back to France. Supported by his Lieutenant, he walked
all night making about 35 kilometers on foot. He arrived
at Charancy and got by train to Mont-Midi. On alighting,
he could not walk. He said he was bent in two, and shuffled
on in this position.</p>

<p>The “bent-back” lasted about a month, when he began to
stand up again. He passed through various hospitals and
was evacuated to the Salpêtrière. He then walked with the
left leg in extension on the thigh and the foot in external
rotation. He was hardly able to stand on either foot, and
especially fell if he tried to stand on the left foot. He made
no resistance to passive movements of the left lower extremity.
The reflexes were normal except that the left plantar
reflex was abolished. On the right, the plantar reflex was
normal, and an attempt to elicit this reflex was followed by
strong defensive movements. There was a tactile, thermic,
and pain anesthesia of the foot and leg as far up as the lower
third of the thigh. Above this anesthesia, there was a zone
of hypesthesia. Position sense was also abolished in this region,
and there was a bony hypesthesia likewise. A slight
muscular atrophy (2 cm.) affected the lower leg and thigh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span></p>

<p>There were no hereditary or acquired features of importance
in the case except that there had been at 14 a chorea for
a year. In particular this man appears not to have been an
emotional person.</p>

<p>The point in the case is the abolition of the plantar reflex
on the left side, in association with a functional paraplegia
and hemianesthesia.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> plantar reflex modification in hysteria, Babinski believes
that the same law which holds that hysteria is not in line to
alter either the tendon reflexes or the pupil reflexes, is true for
the skin reflexes. Dejerine brought forward three cases which
appeared to him, however, to demonstrate absolutely that
functional anesthesia might abolish or greatly diminish the
skin reactions of the sole of the foot, that is, the plantar
reflexes and movements of defense. <a href="#case385">Case 385</a> was alleged
in support of Dejerine, as also were cases of Jeanselme and
Huet, and of Sollier. Babinski’s critique of Dejerine’s cases
ran to the effect that two of them showed contractures, and
accordingly were not pure cases in which to demonstrate
plantar reflexes or movements of defense. In the third case,
Babinski at a meeting of the Neurological Society, himself
obtained definite flexion of the little toes by stimulating the
planta. According to Babinski, therefore, Dejerine’s cases,
far from proving that hysterical anesthesia could abolish
the plantar cutaneous reflexes, proved that hysterical contracture
might mask reflex movements. Hysterical contracture,
therefore, may be as important a factor to consider <i>re</i>
reflexes as voluntary muscular contracture itself. As Babinski
pointed out, many normal persons can keep the leg
immobile when the sole is stimulated. Moreover, Babinski
pointed out, many cases regarded as hysterical were actually
cases of a physiopathic or reflex nature which had
actually undergone trauma. It will be noted that the above
case of Paulian is just such a case of trauma.</p>

</div>

<h4><b>Case 386.</b> (<span class="smcap">Souques</span>, February, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A reserve lieutenant, September, 1914, was blown up by a
shell and lost consciousness for an hour. On coming to, he
felt pains in the loins, right thigh, knee and heel, and found
himself unable to move the right leg at all. Urinary incontinence
lasted three or four days. Violent pains lasted weeks,
now and then actual crises (sleep only with hypnotics).</p>

<p>The pains then passed off. The flaccid crural monoplegia
lasted. There was a hydrarthrosis of the right knee and a
sciatica (physical nerve changes?) and a crural monoplegia
without trophic, electrical, reflex or vesico-rectal trouble.
Lumbar puncture showed no lymphocytes or excess of albumin.
It would, of course, be difficult to tell whether this
case was hysteria or simulation.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> hysterical monoplegia, Babinski inquires whether a
hysterical monoplegia can automatically appear as a result
of emotion without any intellectual element whatever. Emotion
produces sweat, diarrhea or erythema, without any
intellectual intermediate. Can emotion&mdash;that is, emotional
shock&mdash;produce a monoplegia in the same way as
it produces an erythema? The narratives of patients might
indicate that emotion can do such things. But according to
Babinski there is no genuine case of monoplegia or paraplegia
directly produced by emotional shock. One must be
careful in this discussion not to confuse emotional shock and
emotion of a gradual nature. Babinski wishes to define emotion
as a violent affective change as a result of a sudden
mental shock upsetting physiologic or psychic balance during
a usually brief period. As for the more gradual affective
states or emotions, there is obviously so much of the imaginative
and intellectual compounded therewith, that plenty
of opportunity exists for the production by suggestion of
such phenomena as monoplegia, paraplegia, hemi-anesthesia.</p>

<h4><b>Case 387.</b> (<span class="smcap">Roussy</span>, February, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A Zouave was taken out from under a trench shelter beam,
the night of December 21, 1914, at Tracy-le-Mont. The
beam had fallen upon eight men, killing one, and striking the
Zouave in the hypogastrium. He was pulled out two hours
later, unable to take a step. He was evacuated on his back,
to Paris; stayed a month in the hospital at Croix-Rouge,
bedfast. According to the patient, he was entirely anesthetic
in the legs. He went to Villejuif, January 22, with
the diagnosis of spinal contusion and hemiplegia. He could
then walk on crutches, leaning on the left leg. He felt a
sharp pain at the level of the spinous process of the first
lumbar vertebra and all along the sacrum. Spontaneous
movements of the left leg were possible, but they were slow
and weak. The hypesthesia rose to the navel. There was a
suggestion of a cauda syndrome. The knee-jerks were normal,
but on the left side the Achilles jerk was absent. There
was a partial R. D. in the posterior muscles of the left leg.</p>

<p>The diagnosis was functional paraplegia plus left internal
popliteal neuritis. The crutches were removed, he was isolated,
and given motor reëducation. In a week he was able
to walk alone with ease.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> popliteal nerve lesions, Athanassio-Benisty remarks that
the external popliteal nerve of the leg resembles pathologically
the musculospiral nerve of the arm, whereas the internal
popliteal behaves like the median. The musculospiral
nerve of the arm shows very variable and usually
slight sensory changes. The median nerve more than any
other nerve in the arm yields painful sensations during its
recovery from section.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> differentiation of peripheral neuritis and hysterical
paralysis, Babinski gives as signs peculiar to neuritis, and
never found in hysterical paralysis, the following: (<i>a</i>) diminution
or loss of bone and tendon reflexes; (<i>b</i>) muscular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>
atrophy (except for slight amyotrophy exceptionally found
in hysteria); (<i>c</i>) the reaction of degeneration (only of value
after eight or ten days); (<i>d</i>) hypotonus; (<i>e</i>) distribution
characteristic of peripheral motor sensory and trophic
disorder.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> diagnosis of organic paraplegia as against hysterical
paraplegia, the latter is to be recognized chiefly by the absence
of the organic signs, as (<i>a</i>) alteration of tendon reflexes,
(<i>b</i>) the Babinski sign (toe phenomenon), (<i>c</i>) exaggeration of
defense reflexes (dorsal flexion of foot on sharp pinching of

<p>Bullet in hip: Local “stupor” of leg.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 388.</b> (<span class="smcap">Sebileau</span>, November, 1914.)</h4>

<p>A Moroccan sharpshooter, 20, was wounded September
27, at Soissons. One bullet scratched the left thigh. A
second entered below the anterosuperior iliac spine at least
6 cm. outside the femoral artery and emerged above the
ischiotrochanteric line, 2 cm. above and 4 cm. behind the
upper extremity of the great trochanter, thus passing through
the tensor of the fascia lata and without breaking a bone.</p>

<p>There was a complete paralysis of the left leg. The man
had to walk with a crutch and a cane, dragging the leg like a
weight. There was no active or passive movement of thigh,
lower leg and foot muscles, except that there was a slight
tendency to abduction of the toes, from innervation of the
dorsal interossei of the foot. The iliopsoas was also involved,
as well as the gluteal and pelvic trochanteric muscles. There
was a certain amount of muscular tone preserved, so that the
bony elements of the skeleton were held together. The foot
did not fall and the leg did not elongate, as it might have in a
case of paralysis of the sciatic nerve. Electro-diagnosis
showed an early reaction of degeneration according to one
examiner, but Sebileau believes that there was no R. D.
There was anesthesia of a large part of the leg, which stretched
over the anterior and internal aspects of the thigh, covered
the entire territory of obturator and crural nerves but did
not stretch above the fold of the groin. The region of the
femorocutaneous nerve was slightly sensitive and the posterior
aspect of the thigh and buttock was sensitive. There
was a slight sensation on the external aspect of the lower leg.
Foot and toes were entirely insensitive. The anesthesia was
for all forms of common sensation. No vasomotor, thermic
or trophic disorder. The reflexes were all abolished, except
for a tendency to cremasteric reflex. It is clear that these
conditions cannot be simulated. Possibly they are hysteric
and to be explained on the basis of a kind of autosuggestion
or perhaps, according to Sebileau, the local and nervous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span>
apparatus under the mechanical and caloric effects of the
fragment had undergone a sort of local stupor. No large
nerve could have been affected by the injury, according to
the analysis made by Sebileau.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> stupor, see <a href="#case253">Case 253</a> of Tinel. <i>Re</i> such local “stupor”
it may be noted that this case was published in 1914, before
Babinski’s larger publications on reflex disorders. As for
the loss of cutaneous reflexes, Babinski remarks that immersion
in hot water may cause the cutaneous reflexes in the
so-called physiopathic cases to reappear for a time. He
regards the loss of cutaneous reflexes in the physiopathic
cases as due to a circulatory disturbance, and recalls the
fact that compression by an Esmarch bandage can cause
the tendon reflexes to vanish for a time, and can even cause
pathologically excessive reflexes to disappear. The cutaneous
reflexes have also been caused to disappear by compression.</p>

<p>According to Babinski, Sebileau’s explanation that such
matters as loss of reflexes could be explained by autosuggestion
is erroneous.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> muscular hypertonus in reflex cases, Babinski remarks
that though it may be very pronounced, it is as a rule restricted
in area. <i>Re</i> sensory disorders in reflex cases, pains
are found (they were very slight ones in the present case);
hypesthesia has also been found by Babinski.</p>

<p>Localized catalepsy: Hysterotraumatic.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 389.</b> (<span class="smcap">Sollier</span>, January, 1917.)</h4>

<p>An invalided soldier had been suffering for a year with
marked atrophies and the right knee in extension. There
had been a bullet wound of the upper third of the tibia, which
did not affect the joint. There was a total anesthesia, both
superficial and deep, which stopped sharply at the upper
part of the thigh. At the time of the very first examination,
this apparent ankylosis was reduced, to the great stupefaction
of the patient. There was, however, a peculiar phenomenon
in this subject. There was a localized catalepsy of
the limb, which was able to preserve any desired attitude in
which it was placed; and this attitude could be indefinitely
prolonged, just as in cataleptic hysterics. Here, then, was a
case of localized hystero-traumatism precisely imitating the
classical hysteria of Charcot except for its localization.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> hysterotraumatism, Charcot developed ideas concerning
trauma and localized hysteria in 1886, thereby overthrowing
the ideas of Erichsen concerning the organic nature
of “railway spine” and “railway brain” as developed twenty
years before. In a case of local trauma such as the bullet-wound
of <a href="#case388">Case 388</a>, Babinski’s explanation would be that the
pain and inhibition of movement resulting from the bullet
wound at the time of injury, formed the focus of a process of
autosuggestion. According to Babinski’s figure, the organic
factor acts as a <i>bait</i> for the hysterical symptoms. According
to the Salpêtrière experience, hysteria is incapable of
producing a real superficial and deep anesthesia such as is
mentioned for this case. For example, no hysterical patient
in the Charcot clinic, according to Sicard, could undergo a
scalpel operation without some general or local anesthetic.
When, therefore, a true deep anesthesia occurs, Sicard’s
conception would be that the anesthesia is not a truly hysterical
one but belongs to the group of physiopathic phenomena.</p>

<p>Contracture: Hysterotraumatic.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 390.</b> (<span class="smcap">Sollier</span>, January, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A sailor, 41, got hygroma of the right knee in 1915, was
operated on in July, returned to his dépôt a month later, and
thence to Vizille Urage by reason of contracture in extension
of the right leg. It was thought he was simulating (since
there was no muscular atrophy), and he was sent to the
neurological center, where under anesthesia the joint was
found free. This man developed, when the knee was bent,
extraordinary cracklings in the joint, and he showed pain
unequivocally, making a defensive movement, partly reflex,
partly voluntary, when the leg was flexed beyond a certain
point. There was 3.5 cm. atrophy in the thigh, a reflex
atrophy due to the joint disorder. There were no other
signs of hysterotraumatic contracture.</p>

<p>According to Sollier, the diagnosis of hysterotraumatic
contractures depends upon: first, a characteristic special attitude
of the contractured limb; secondly, the participation of
the antagonists as a group (<i>global</i>); thirdly, the superposition
of sensory disorder upon motor disorder (Charcot’s law);
fourthly, the segmentary topography of sensory disorder;
fifthly, the extension of the contractured joint; sixthly, the
persistence of the contracture in the same form, whether at
rest or in attempted movements; seventhly, muscular rigidity;
eighthly, normal tendon reflexes; ninthly, normal electrical
reactions (though R. D. is hard to determine in muscles contracted
to the maximum); tenthly, special reactions during
attempts to reduce, such as pains, and equal and regular
resistance to changed attitude, pseudoclonus in cases of foot
contracture; eleventhly, immediate reproduction of the contracture
after reduction under chloroform; twelfthly, co-existence
of various hysterical stigmata.</p>

<p>Crural monoplegia, tetanic. Recovery.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 391.</b> (<span class="smcap">Routier</span>, 1915.)</h4>

<p>An ensign was wounded by a shell splinter in the right
scapular region September 25, 1915. A large hematoma was
drawn off and drains inserted. Antitetanic serum was given
24 hours after the trauma. The wound looked well. The
patient complained merely of the heaviness of his arm, and
after September 27, the temperature fell to normal. Magnesium
chloride solution was applied every other day, and
progress was so good that evacuation was ordered.</p>

<p>However, October 8, the patient suddenly began to complain
of a sharp pain in the right thigh, which next day became
intolerable and threw the muscles into a slight contracture,
the adductors being extremely stiff. Headache
developed in the course of the day, with slight stiffness of
neck, exaggeration of reflexes in the right leg, and ankle
clonus. Temperature: 37.6 morning, 38.5 evening. The
patient was isolated and given chloral.</p>

<p>October 10, paroxysmal crises of pain, more marked stiff
neck, and lumbar stiffness appeared, with nervousness,
photophobia, and hyperesthesia to noise. The wound seemed
to be doing well. Chloral was given.</p>

<p>Slight trismus developed October 11. The tongue became
dry and the patient drank little. The condition held and the
same treatments were repeated up to October 15, when the
temperature fell and the contractures and pains were diminished.
The chloral was continued. There were still a few
cramps in the neck. October 22, however, the patient was
practically well.</p>

<p>We are here dealing with an instance of local tetanus of
monoplegic form, developing a fortnight after the wound
(there is an early group developing, as a rule, from the fifth
to the tenth day, and a group of later development, after
the twentieth day; the interval in this case was of intermediate
duration). According to Courtois-Suffit and
Giroux, the differential diagnosis is not easy, since, besides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span>
tetanus, must be considered tetany, spastic monoplegia of
cerebral or spinal origin, partial hemiplegia, peripheral neuritis,
contractures due to bone, joint, muscle or tendon
lesions, strychnine intoxication and hysterical contractures.
Three cases out of six described by Routier were fatal.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> differential diagnosis of tetanic conditions, see Courtois-Suffit
and Giroux in the <i>Collection Horizon</i>. The cases
as a rule appear in subjects that have had serum treatment,
and may occur in subjects in whom no trismus ever develops
(the above case showed slight trismus).</p>

<p>The recognition of localized tetanic contracture is based
upon (<i>a</i>) the intensity of the contracture, which causes the
limb to feel wooden (in one case the foot, leg, and thigh
were welded to the pelvis like an iron bar); (<i>b</i>) paroxysmal
contractions resembling those of tetanus, confined to one
limb, and started by a variety of external causes, forming
the principal symptom in the disease; (<i>c</i>) contracture of
comparatively brief duration (hardly ever over two or three
weeks). A slight fever may help in the differential diagnosis.</p>

<h4><b>Case 392.</b> (<span class="smcap">Mériel</span>, 1916.)</h4>

<p>An infantryman was wounded by shell fragments September
28, 1915, at Virginy and was given a first dressing an
hour later and a second at the ambulance, where antitetanic
injection was also made. October 3, the patient arrived at
Foix, showing a superficial wound of the left frontal region,
a penetrating wound of the upper third of the left thigh, and
another in the lower third of the left lower leg.</p>

<p>The evening of October 8, the man began to feel pain in
the left leg, though the wounds looked well and there was
no fever. October 9, sudden involuntary contractions of the
left leg developed, and these increased in amplitude if the
limb was touched. The other extremities were normal.
Temperature 38.2; pulse 102. Restlessness at night.</p>

<p>Next day 10 c.c. of antitetanic serum was administered and
more on the 11th, with chloral and isolation; but on the
evening of the 11th, with the contractions still completely
localized to the left lower extremity, came an extremely
painful crisis interfering with sleep and at last requiring
morphine. Up to the 15th the antitetanic injections, chloral
and morphine were continued, but on the 15th the contractions
were replaced in part by a contracture affecting the
muscles of the posterior aspect of the thigh. In the meantime,
the patient howled with pain, especially in the night.
Chloral and morphine were given.</p>

<p>During the next five days the contractures and pains became
still more violent, and on the 21st the antitetanic injections
were begun once more and kept up through the 26th
in 5 c.c. doses.</p>

<p>The patient began to urinate in bed and to be delirious.
The contractions now disappeared, but the contracture persisted.
Antitetanic serum was given every other day from
October 28 to November 2; every third day from November<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span>
4 to November 19; every fourth day from November 22
to December 3; and every fifth day from December 3 to
December 17. The chloral was diminished from 15 to 5
grams per diem and by the 20th of December all administration
of chloral had ceased. The morphine was given up
December 25.</p>

<p>The tetanic symptoms of the left leg now gradually diminished.
The leg, which had been flexed at a right angle,
began to extend little by little, and the toes, which had been
strongly flexed, reassumed their normal position. The
wounds suppurated freely during the tetanic crises, but then
healed. In January the man could get up and walk, dragging
his leg somewhat, and January 20 a complete recovery
had been obtained. There was no hysteria in the history of
this patient, although the man was subject to “professional”
alcoholism, being carter for a wholesale wine dealer, drinking
5 liters of wine a day.</p>

him, flattening his knapsack, throwing him to the ground,
blowing him forward (as he said, by the pressure of the
air) seven or eight meters, leaving him stunned though conscious
for about twenty minutes. Uhlans fell upon him but
did not trouble themselves further with him as he could
not walk. He crawled along on elbows and knees about a
kilometer and a half to some Frenchmen in a wood. He now
found himself able to walk a whole day supported by two
comrades, making about 12 kilometers. He got by carriage
to Gerbéviller, but here fell again into the hands of Germans,
who left him nine days in the corner of a barn without care.
Gerbéviller was retaken, and he was evacuated to Bayon.</p>

the slightest movement, and two months followed before

three months and a half after his accident,&mdash;he was demonstrated
as “spinal contusion.” Upon examination, however,
there were no reflex disorders, no sensory disorders, and the
muscular weakness was equal in all parts of the lower extremities
and trunk. On crutches, he lunged the trunk forward,
painfully dragging his legs one after the other, the
right foot in external rotation, never passing the left foot,
toes scraping ground,&mdash;a functional flaccid paraplegia, completely

<h4><b>Case 394.</b> (<span class="smcap">Clarke</span>, July, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A soldier, 40, got a scalp wound but probably did not lose
consciousness. However, when observed three months after
the injury, though fat and well-looking, the patient could not
stand or walk, and his hands and arms were feeble. He
complained of headache, insomnia and anorexia, and remained
in a state of mental inertia. All efforts to read and
write produced fatigue. Memory was bad both for remote
and for recent events. He was able to feed himself slowly,
execute a few movements of arms and hands, and raise his
feet from the bed. Upon passive movement, there was a
sort of spastic state, which did not amount to a true rigidity.
Now and then a clonic spasm was induced by such passive
movements. After the repetition of those few voluntary
movements which were possible, the muscles passed into a
flaccid condition. There was a tremor of a type called
swooping; the tremor resembled that of Friedreich’s disease,
such as is thought to occur in cases of marked loss of
muscular sense. The deep reflexes were exaggerated. Concentric
narrowing of the visual fields was easily induced by
testing them. There was a general slight dulness of perception
on sensory tests. There was astereognosis, and apparently
an absolute loss of position sense. Movements of the
large joints through an angle of 90 degrees were, however,
vaguely recognized. Although the patient could not touch,
for example, his left forefinger with his right, yet, if he had
once seen the position of a limb and it was not moved, he
could remember its position and touch it after some time.
His localizing sense was from two to four inches out in the
hands, the localization being generally of points proximal to
the point tested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span></p>

<p>Two months later the patient was somewhat less dull and
apathetic. His memory had improved. He was able to
read, and he was successfully making a rug; but the legs
were worse, having become anesthetic to touch and pain.
When the legs were placed in any position, they would assume
a cataleptic rigidity, and remain rigidly fixed in any
position for some time. The patient could sit up in bed.
The muscles were well nourished and the electric reactions
were normal.</p>

<h4><b>Case 395.</b> (<span class="smcap">Myers</span>, January, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A private, 23, was admitted to a casualty clearing station
and the next day told the examiner, Major Myers, that the
Germans had been sending whizz-bangs and coal-boxes over,
and the last he remembered was being on guard and then
digging himself out of fallen sandbags. His comrades told
him that he had been pitched in the air, but this he did not
remember. He remembered running to the shell trench,
but finding this “too hot,” he returned to the firing trench,
noticing on the way that he could not see well. He lay in
the dug-out, flinching at each shell, and “trying to get into
the smallest possible corner.” He tried to do guard duty that
night, but, when some one noticed involuntary spasmodic
movements, he was ordered to go back to the dug-out, was
helped to the regimental aid post by two men, and was sent
to hospital. He had been in France eight months and had
been shaken up somewhat four months before, when bombs
threw dirt in his face. At that time, his hands and handwriting
had become tremulous, but he had not reported sick.
He was depressed and wanted Major Myers to make him well.
It seems that he had shrugged his shoulders and made leg
movements, diving beneath the bedclothes, and bringing his
knees to his chin. When Major Myers examined him, the
leg movements were due solely “to strong periodic simultaneous
contractions of the two sartorius muscles, the rate
of contraction of which varied from 60 to 70 per minute,
increasing to 90 during the excitement of examination.”
There were special changes of sensibility in the right leg and
arm and right side of the face and chest, not involving the
abdomen. The patellar reflex was exaggerated; plantar reflexes
could not be obtained. The legs were tremulous,
especially when the patient lifted them, whereas the hands and
tongue were only faintly tremulous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span></p>

<p>Under light hypnosis, events in the amnestic period were
recalled, and details as to the shell’s direction, process of
lifting up, and fall. Under deeper hypnosis, the sartorius
contractions diminished but did not disappear. Appropriate
suggestion was made, and upon arousal from hypnosis,
the movements ceased, the headache disappeared, memory
was recovered, and the unilateral disturbances of sensibility
had vanished.</p>

<p>As to the possibility of malingering in this case, Major
Myers calls attention to the disorders of sensibility which he
believes could hardly have been simulated, to the persistence
of spasmodic movements during sleep, to their confinement to
the sartorii, and to the spastic condition of legs, such that
when the thighs were passively raised the knees remained
extended.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> persistence of hysterical phenomena in sleep, Ballet
felt that he could prove that some hysterical contractures
persisted during sleep, and Sollier has written a special
article to the same effect. Ballet’s case had a contracture
developing after an operation on the first metacarpal bone.
The contracture which followed would be then probably,
upon Babinski’s analysis, a reflex contracture and not a
hysterical one. Duvernay, Sicard, and Babinski himself
have noted the persistence of reflex contractures during
sleep, to say nothing of their persistence under an advanced
stage of chloroform narcosis. In fact, these reflex contractures
are exactly as fixed and persistent as contractures of
clearly organic origin. It is probable that Babinski would
define Myers’ case (<a href="#case395">395</a>) as a physiopathic one; yet against
this diagnosis would be the disappearance of the movements
after hypnosis. As against hysteria, it will be noted that
the patellar reflex was exaggerated, and that the plantar
reflexes could not be obtained.</p>

<p>Shell-shock: Brown-Séquard syndrome, hematomyelic?</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 396.</b> (<span class="smcap">Ballet</span>, August, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A soldier, 24, went to the front November 12, 1914, and
June 1, 1915, had a shell burst near him in the trench, on the
occasion of which he felt a violent shock, as if a blow in the
kidneys. He felt suddenly paralyzed in both legs. He was
crouching at the time of the shell burst. His legs felt dead,
and he had such violent pain in the thorax as to make
breathing difficult. He was carried to a shelter. After a
few hours, the left leg began to move again.</p>

<p>He was carried to the ambulance, remaining there five days,
unable to walk, though able to move and turn in bed,
slightly constipated, with persistent pains in back. He was
then carried to Auxiliary Hospital 231, at Paris, and a
bullet (!) was found superficially lodged in the region of the
left scapula. Neither patient nor physicians had hitherto
observed the bullet, which could have had nothing to do with
any spinal lesion.</p>

<p>The pains, in the course of a month, grew less, and at the
end of two or three weeks he began to walk and was sent to
the psychoneurosis service at Ville-Évrard, July 10. He
then complained of pain in the right thorax, especially on
movement or after sitting up some time. He could hardly
bring himself to the sitting posture from the bed, and found
difficulty in raising the right leg therefrom. In walking, the
<i>right leg</i> was dragged behind. The reflexes were increased on
the right side. There was ankle clonus without Babinski
sign. Anesthesia to touch over the whole of the <i>left leg</i>.
Anesthesia to pin prick and temperature as far as the umbilicus.
Cold was not felt on the left side.</p>

<p>The water of a bath seemed lukewarm on the left side and
warm on the right. The left side of the scrotum and the left
half of the penis showed the same disorder of sensibility.
There was a zone of hypesthesia on the <i>right</i> side of the thorax
in the region of the lower ribs. The patient compared his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span>
sensations while at rest and without contact to a sensation of
painful pressure occurring intermittently, or rather in paroxysms,
not advancing beyond the median line of the back.
Here was a question of Brown-Séquard syndrome, probably
due to a slight hematomyelia, but associated with no external
lesion or any injury to the vertebral column.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> Brown-Séquard’s syndrome, see Athanassio-Benisty
with respect to spinal cord symptoms associated with lesions
of the brachial plexus. It appears that the combination of
spinal cord and brachial plexus injury is not uncommon.
Note in this case that a bullet was found in the left scapula
region. According to Ballet, this bullet could have had
nothing to do with a spinal lesion.</p>

<h4><b>Case 397.</b> (<span class="smcap">Smyly</span>, April, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A man (also injured in 1906 by the fall of a heavy weight
on his back) went to France in 1914 as a soldier, and eight
months later was hurled into a shell hole so that his back
struck the edge. He was rendered unconscious. Upon recovery
of consciousness, the right leg was found to be swollen,
and there were severe pains in the legs and back.</p>

<p>Upon return home the patient went from one hospital to
another, for the most part unable to walk, suffering from
agonizing pain in head and eyes. Insomnia and waking
dreams.</p>

<p>He was able to bring himself to an upright position and to
rush a few steps. He has now acquired considerable control
of the feet by the aid of crutches. Insomnia persisted.</p>

<p>Dysbasia: Psychogenic (cerebellar nucleus (?))</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 398.</b> (<span class="smcap">Cassirer</span>, February, 1916.)</h4>

<p>On March 9, 1915, a shell wounded a man slightly, and
burned off some of the hair of his head. He was unconscious
two days, and on waking vomited for a time. Shortly
after the injury difficulties in standing and walking set in,
with headache, noises in the left ear, difficulty in the intake of
ideas, excitability, and poor memory. Then, slight improvement.
About the middle of June he was no longer closely
confined to bed and could take a few steps with two canes;
but the gait was still unsteady and the left leg tended to make
abnormal-looking movements. There was nystagmus, rapid,
though constant, on looking to the left,&mdash;more in the left
eye; and nystagmus on looking to the right,&mdash;more in the
right eye. Adiadochokinesis absent. Vestibular nerve somewhat
excitable. Deviation outward in finger-pointing test.</p>

<p>According to Cassirer, this case is one largely of psychogenic
origin, with possibly an organic cerebellar nucleus. The knee-jerks
absent (even up to March 31). W. R. negative.</p>

</div>

<h4><b>Case 399.</b> (<span class="smcap">Hurst</span>, May, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A private, 29, was knocked over by a shell explosion
December, 1914. He was unconscious two days, found that
he could not move either right arm or left leg, got some
power back shortly, but, if he tried to stand, experienced involuntary
violent movements in the left leg.</p>

<p>April 1, 1915, response to questions was slow and speech
slow. The right arm and grip were weak. If the left hand
was clenched, there was an associated movement of the right
hand; but on clenching the right hand, no associated movement
was produced in the left. The musculature was equal
on the two sides, and the tendon reflexes of the arms were
brisk and equal. Light tactile stimuli were hard to localize.
Movements of the left leg were somewhat weak, though the
musculature was equal on the two sides. The knee-jerks
were brisk, the left slightly brisker. Sometimes a well-marked
ankle clonus could be obtained on the left side, but
sometimes not. The plantar reflex was constantly flexor.
Babinski’s second sign (combined flexion of thigh and pelvis)
was well marked on the left side.</p>

<p>On attempts to walk, the left leg would move rapidly from
side to side, round the point of contact of toes with ground.
When a step forward was taken with the right leg, the left
one dragged, and made irregular movements.</p>

<p>This gait seemed obviously hysterical. The patient was
kept in hospital for a month. He was very easily hypnotizable,
but even in deep hypnosis leg movements could not
be controlled when he was told to walk. The first whiff of
ether hypnotized but did not cure him.</p>

<p>On the whole, upon review, Hurst believes that there may
have been organic brain changes, which (<i>a</i>) the associated
movement of the paralyzed hand when the normal hand was
contracting, (<i>b</i>) the slightly increased left knee-jerk, (<i>c</i>) tendency
to ankle-clonus, and (<i>d</i>) Babinski’s second sign, may
show.</p>

<p>Peculiar walking tic.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 400.</b> (<span class="smcap">Chavigny</span>, April, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A soldier was found with a peculiar walking tic. He would
rest a good deal longer on the left leg than on the right. He
would make a sudden movement of the right leg forward, as
if on a spring. At the same time, the man’s head would give
a violent movement to the right just as the right leg was
receiving the weight of the body. The idea of this movement
seemed to be that the center of gravity would be shifted
and the work of the right leg would be relieved. This peculiar
walk was naturally very slow. If the walk was slowed down,
it became quite normal. There was no pain at the basis of
this walk. If the man hopped, he hopped no more painfully
on the right leg, nor with greater difficulty, than upon the
left.</p>

<p>This man was guilty of desertion in the face of the enemy,
and of desertion in the interior in time of war. He said he
could not walk well and that he needed to take care of himself
at his mother’s house, as he was not considered sick in his
regiment. He had been wounded with two bullets, September
28, 1914, which struck him on the internal aspects of the
knees. He was treated in hospital from October to the end
of November, 1914; was held at the dépôt of his regiment
from December to August, 1915. He was then put in hospital
a month, and returned to his dépôt for three more months.
He was examined by three physicians in August, 1915, and the
commission decided that he was fit for service, and a simulator.</p>

<p>Thorough examination, including electrical and X-ray
examinations, showed no lesion. Chavigny observed the
patient for a long time, from the 21st of November, 1916, to
January 5, 1917. Shells dropped near the hospital, December
2, and, following orders, the patients were taken into a
vaulted cellar, and they ran thither very rapidly; but this
patient could not hurry. He walked slowly, with the same
tic. Surely the tic would be rather a difficult one to imagine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[560]</a></span>
and a somewhat more probable set of symptoms would
ordinarily be chosen. The man has not the unstable nature
of the ordinary victim of tic. On the contrary, he has rather
the invincible obstinacy of a hysterotraumatic. On being
shown that he could walk properly without these “para”
movements, he would reply, “I can’t do anything else,” and
he shook his head upon being told that he could be cured.</p>

<p>Reëducation of his anesthetic areas (there was a zone of
diminution in sensibility to pin-prick in the knee region, and
a complete anesthesia of the sole of the foot, with abolition of
the plantar reflex), reëducation by appropriate gymnastics,
and mental reëducation, might be attempted in a special neurological
hospital.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> disorders of gait, Laignel-Lavastine and Courbon divide
functional gait disorders into three groups: (<i>a</i>) A group

disorders into two groups: (<i>a</i>) A group termed by them

<p>Mine explosion; unconsciousness: Camptocormia.

<h4><b>Case 401.</b> (<span class="smcap">Marie</span>, <span class="smcap">Meige</span>, <span class="smcap">Béhagne</span>, February, 1917;
<span class="smcap">Souques</span> and <span class="smcap">Mégevand</span>, February, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A man became a hospital rounder to all points of the compass
in France during a period of twenty months, with such
diagnoses as myelopathic disorder, complex spinal trouble,
ataxic phenomena.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact he was a camptocormic: trunk bent,
knees semi-flexed, legs in external rotation. He used two
canes in locomotion, made a bowing movement with each
20 cm. step, then another bowing movement, and another
little step with the other foot. Made to lie down, his legs
would elongate, the right completely but the left with some
difficulty, the feet going into hyperextension, with the big
toe raised, others flexed; the feet externally rotating, plantae
turned in. In horizontal decubitus, there was only slight
lumbar discomfort, but the legs stiffened and gave quick
convulsive jerks. Taking the posture several times in succession
would diminish these phenomena. Kneeling, he
could bring his heels within 10 cm. of the buttock, whereas
in spontaneous flexion of the leg on the thigh, the knee remained
a distance of 40 cm. from the buttock.</p>

<p>A complete examination showed no joint disorder or any
diminution in muscular strength, or any reflex disorder except
that all the tendon reflexes were rather powerful. There
was a question of possible X-ray demonstration of lesions and
ankylosis of the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae, and there
was a question of some incontinence of urine. On the basis
of these phenomena apparently, this camptocormic patient
had been saddled with the diagnosis of myelopathic and
ataxic disorder for a period of 16 months. A neurologist was
at last consulted, and on his advice, it proved possible to get
the patient evacuated to a neurological center in a period of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span>
four months. Facts of this species are unfortunately still too
common, state Marie, Meige and Béhagne, February 1, 1917,
despite the remarkable and rapid cures obtained in camptocormia
by Souques. In point of fact, no complete neurological
examination had been performed upon this man
during a period of 20 months.</p>

<p>This particular patient was given to Souques for treatment
(Souques and Mégevand). His cure was completed by persuasive
electrotherapy, in an hour.</p>

<p>It appears that the man was buried in a mine explosion,
June 5, 1915, lost consciousness and came to twenty hours
later, able to rise and take a few steps, but bent in two
with a sharp dorsolumbar pain. The pain grew more violent
and generalized during the next few days, and he began to
lose all power in his legs, so that he could walk with the
greatest difficulty. He was practically bedfast for five
months. He then tried to rise and walk, but suffered so
much that he could not get up except in a camptocormic
position. It was in fact only January 23, 1917, at the
Salpêtrière, that the diagnosis of camptocormia was made.
The man complained of pains at the lower dorsal and lumbar
regions of the spinal column with slight irradiation sidewise.
The following diagnoses had been made:</p>

<p>June 8, 1915. Severe contusion of chest and back.</p>

<p>July 9, 1915. Multiple contusions, commotio spinalis;
lesions and ankylosis of the 4th and 5th lumbar vertebrae
(X-ray examination).</p>

<p>Sept. 3, 1916. Lumbar intervertebral arthritis with compression
of roots.</p>

<p>Nov. 4, 1916. Myelopathic disorder.</p>

<p>Dec. 5, 1916. Old complex spinal disorder.</p>

<p>Souques remarks that these diagnoses show that knowledge
about camptocormia has not penetrated into most of the
sanitary formations (1917).</p>

<h4><b>Case 402.</b> (<span class="smcap">Guillain</span> and <span class="smcap">Barré</span>, January, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A soldier was evacuated to the 6th Army neurological
center for paraplegia with tremor. He had been in various
hospitals <i>for a period of a year</i>. The tendon reflexes of the
arms appeared increased; there was a suspicion of patellar
clonus and of foot clonus, and it had been proposed to invalid
the man for spastic paralysis. In point of fact, the man was
suffering from an epileptoid trepidation of the foot and of the
patella. When he was lying down, his motor disorders practically
passed away, though they had been very marked when
he tried to stand upright or to walk. He had much trouble
in walking, but could readily stand for some time on one leg.</p>

<p>The man was forthwith treated by persuasive methods.
It is important to find out the organic lesion which in all
probability served as a starting point for the functional
disease, and important to remove or abolish this lesion however
minute if a complete and lasting cure is to be obtained.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> astasia-abasia, writers have remarked that it is one of
the commonest hysterical syndromes in the war, though
somewhat rare in its complete form. Roussy and Lhermitte
state that it usually follows the explosion of a large
calibre projectile and has a rapid onset. It is often an isolated
phenomenon, without emotional or other Shell-shock
complications. The victim has been thrown to the ground
and rolled into a trench or hollow. Sometimes the victim
gets back to the first-aid post, only to find himself on arrival
at the ambulance wholly unable to walk. The legs, however,
are drawn along inertly, as in paraplegia, or a pronounced
contracture interferes with walking.</p>

<p>Astasia-abasia is classified with hysteria major, hysterical
hemiplegia, hysterotraumatic brachial monoplegia, glossolabial
hemispasm, hysterical mutism, and rhythmic chorea,
as so characteristic that differential diagnosis is superfluous.
According to Babinski, no functional spasm and no organic
disease can reproduce hysterical astasia-abasia.</p>

<p>Multiple shell wounds, with persistent slight suppuration
of thigh: Abdominothoracic contracture,
tetanic, four months after original injury.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 403.</b> (<span class="smcap">Marie</span>, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A soldier, 31, was wounded in the left arm January, 1915,
and received 10 c.c. antitetanic serum; was wounded again
July 10 in the face, scalp, upper part of the thorax, left arm
and left leg by shell fragments, and again received, two days
later, 10 c.c. antitetanic serum. July 13, at the ophthalmological
center at Rouen the left eye was enucleated on
account of a shell wound, and four days later a fragment was
removed from a phlegmon of the forearm. Later a number
of operations were made for blepharoplasty. The wounds
all healed well except for an apparently insignificant, small
suppuration of the thigh. November 10, four months after
the shell wounds, while apparently in perfect health, the man
began to complain of lancinating, intermittent pains in the
abdomen, thorax and lumbar region. With these pains was
associated a persistent abdominolumbar contracture.</p>

<p>On the suspicion of an abdominal form of local tetanus,
chloral was given; but the condition grew worse. The sudden
contractions spread from the waist to the feet, from November
20 onward, and were felt by the patient as electric shocks.
The arms were not affected. Trouble with breathing supervened
on the night of December 3. Sometimes there were
respiratory pauses for as long as 15 seconds, followed by a
slight polypnea. December 6 the man presented an intense
contracture of the lower part of the trunk. The slightly
retracted abdominal wall was of marbly hardness, but quite
painless. Analgesic muscular rigidity took the place of the
former crises of pain. The dorsolumbar contracture was so
marked as to make an appreciable hollow in the back. The
patient could pick up an object from the ground only by
flexing his knees to the maximum, as the trunk could not be
flexed. There was a very slight trismus, but he could open
his mouth, drink, eat and talk without difficulty. There was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span>
no trace of neck stiffness or of Kernig’s sign. The tendon
reflexes, normal in the arms, were exaggerated in the lower
extremities, especially on the left (wounded) side. The skin
reflexes were also more marked on the left side, especially the
reflex of the tensor of the fascia lata. There was no longer
any evidence of suppuration of the wound of the left thigh,
which had been dried up for a fortnight. The pulse was
somewhat exaggerated (92) and there was a general hyperidrosis,
especially of the face.</p>

<p>Forty c.c. antitetanic serum were given without reaction,
and 4 grams of chloral; five days later, 30 c.c. more serum.
After ten days the abdomen remained hard, though there was
a trifling improvement of the lumbar contracture. There
were no longer any spasmodic crises or respiratory disturbances.
There was a slight serous exudation from the wound.
X-ray showed a small shell fragment 6 cm. below the orifice
of the wound.</p>

<p>The third injection was given December 27 to prevent
mobilization of the bacilli at operation, and on the 28th, the
projectile was removed under local anesthesia from a small,
walled-off, old pus pocket, from which were cultivated bacillus
perfringens and other organisms.</p>

<p>December 31 a distinct improvement set in and January
13 there was little or no trace of previous disease, except that
testing the plantar cutaneous reflex on the left side produced
an exaggerated contraction of the tensor of the fascia lata.
February 15 he was reëxamined and found quite normal.</p>

<p>This case of tetanus limited to the abdominothoracic
muscles (except for a very mild contracture of the masticators)
had as its locus of origin, doubtless, a wound of the
thigh from which the toxin rose along branches of the lumbar
plexus to impregnate the corresponding level of the spinal
cord. Although there was no stiffness of the wounded leg,
yet there was an exaggeration of the tendon reflexes thereof.
The first phase of painful contractures and spasms with
respiratory disorder was succeeded by an analgesic phase of
characteristically tetanic rigidity. The nonfebrile nature of
the disease and the preservation of good general health are
worth noting.</p>

<h4><b>Case 404.</b> (<span class="smcap">Walther</span>, December, 1914.)</h4>

<p>A soldier was struck September 27, near Berry au Bac, by
a shell fragment in the right scapular region and was thrown,
according to his story, 15 meters. Upon entrance at Val-de-Grâce,
October 13, the shoulder-girdle was found intact.
There was a very painful point in the spinous process of the
scapula, suggesting a fracture; but the bone was proved intact
on X-ray. The scapula was very mobile, as if unslung
from the thorax. The arm was paralyzed. On raising the
arm the scapula followed its movements and detached itself
completely from the thorax, dislocating upwards with lively
pain. The fingers could be pushed under the anterior surface
of the scapula, and its internal border proved to be entirely
free of attachment. Pressure along this internal border was
very painful. It seems as if there had been a tearing of the
rhomboid and serratus magnus muscles and probably a part
of the latissimus dorsi under the influence of the violent
shock conveyed by the shell fragment, which had pushed the
scapula forward and upward without injuring the skin.</p>

<p>There was also a complete paralysis of sensation. Paralysis
of motion was complete except for the extensor longus of
the thumb. This motor paralysis had come on progressively
three days after the accident. A radicular paralysis
from an evulsion of the plexus was suspected.</p>

<p>Babinski, however, made the diagnosis of psychic paralysis,
finding the muscles reacting perfectly to percussion. After
a few electric tests with the faradic current voluntary movements
were obtained in all the muscles of the arm and hand.</p>

<p>Treatment was then continued by electricity, massage and
reëducation, so that all movements soon regained strength.
The patient can now himself, by raising his arm, still produce
his dislocation, which still provokes a lively pain.</p>

<h4><b>Case 405.</b> (<span class="smcap">Oppenheim</span>, July, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A reservist sustained, October 2, 1914, a gunshot wound
of the left forearm from a distance of about 1400 meters. He
fainted, lost much blood, and was treated surgically, October
7, in hospital (at this time no complete paralysis of the arm).</p>

<p>In November, however, an incomplete paralysis at first
developed. November 12, the patient was able to flex his
thumb but showed some anesthesia.</p>

<p>Transferred to nerve hospital in December, the patient
said that at the first change of dressings, October 10, he had
not been able to move his arm, and said that pains and paresthesia
had existed in the arm ever since the injury. There was
still some evidence of suppuration at the exit orifice of the
bullet. The left arm was now completely paralyzed and
atonic, and hung down in walking, without swinging. The
supinator phenomenon, though present on the right side, was
absent on the left. The triceps reflex was present. The
shoulder acted like a flail joint. On passive elevation of the
left arm, the deltoid seemed to contract slightly at first; later
it failed to contract. Fibrillary tremor of the left thumb.</p>

<p>Suggestive therapy was unsuccessful. There was an anesthesia
of the left arm and the left trunk. The disorder
diminished proximally, being most severe in the hand and
the arm. The legs were normal. The electrical irritability
of the left arm was only slightly diminished. There was a
well-marked hypertrichosis of the left forearm, the skin of
which was slightly purple and discolored. The patient himself
made an attempt to burn his arm with a lighted cigar, to
see if he could feel the pain. He showed the scar but had
felt nothing. The pectoralis major muscle did not contract.
If the left arm was started actively swinging, it kept on
swinging inertly. The left hand showed hyperidrosis. The
small hand muscles were emaciated but electrically normal.</p>

<h4><b>Case 406.</b> (<i>Romner</i>, March, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A German soldier, 37, wounded his right wrist in the glass
of a door. The hand was put up six weeks long with very
few changes of the bandage on account of suppuration, and
he noticed that the arm was getting weaker and weaker, that
he was losing feeling in it, and that it was beginning to sweat
a good deal, so that now and then drops of sweat would
stream off. The right hand was found markedly congested
and 1.5 cm. larger in circumference. The fingers and hand
were especially weak. There was a marked tremor of the arm.
Electric excitability normal. The sensory disorder was in
glove form. Hypesthesia to touch reached the elbow, analgesia
to a point three fingers’ breadth below the elbow, and
anesthesia to cold to a point two fingers’ breadth still lower,
a sort of stepwise dissociation of sensibility resembling what
is found in spinal lesions. The case was presented as one of
local traumatic hysteria.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> hysterical anesthesia, the rule is that it obeys no definite
rule; that is, it may be a hemianesthesia, a segmentary, an
isolated, or even a pseudo-peripheral anesthesia. It is a question
whether Babinski would attempt to explain Romner’s
case on the basis of medical suggestion, hetero-suggestion,
or autosuggestion.</p>

<p>Myers has had a few instances in which anesthesia spread
gradually, and in which analgesia increased after its onset.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> reëducation of cutaneous sensations, Chavigny recommends
the faradic current in successive applications, marking
the extent of the zone of anesthesia with ink upon the
skin. Each time the current is applied, the inked limits of
the area are lessened. By this form of suggestion, not only
does the anesthesia disappear, but very often the accompanying
paralysis also.</p>

<p>Hysterical contracture, edema and vasomotor disorder.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 407.</b> (<span class="smcap">Ballet</span>, July, 1915.)</h4>

<p>For some unknown reason, a soldier developed a contracture
of the right upper and lower extremities at a time when
a basin of water was offered to him for toilet purposes. Three
days later, this contracture disappeared in the leg but persisted
in the arm at the radiocarpal joint and in the finger
joints. There was also an anesthesia to touch and pain and
temperature which ran up the arm to the shoulder. The tendon
reflexes were normal. On the whole, there seemed to be
no doubt that the case was one of hysterical arm contracture.
Associated with this contracture was a white edema of the
hand. On account of the chances of simulation, the hand
was done up and sealed in such wise that the seals would have
been broken if the splint had been lifted down during the
night. The bandage was in place from June 25 to June 29.
Upon its removal, there was no edema, but the contracture
was still there. The arm was put up upon a cushion so that
the hand would drain to the forearm. The edema was found
capable of returning when the hand was placed below the
level of the shoulder, disappearing when the hand was raised.
The contractured hand was warmer than its fellow. According
to Ballet, we here have an anesthetic instance of contracture
associated with edema and vasomotor disorder.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> edema, Babinski states that no case of hysterical edema
has stood the test of scientific critique. Sometimes a case
turns out one of tuberculous synovitis. Sometimes the
patient is shown artificially to have brought about the edema.
The hysterical “blue edema” of Charcot has not been proved
to exist. Some during the war have been found due to voluntary
constriction. Some of these constriction edemas even
become relatively permanent. Babinski regards the above
case of Ballet, as well as cases of Lebar and of Raynaud, as
not true cases. Raynaud’s case was probably vascular.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> vasomotor disorders in Ballet’s case, the Babinski school,
of course, holds that hysteria cannot cause such disorders.</p>

<p>A road-laborer, 42, in the 268th Infantry, had a bomb
burst about a meter away, March 4, 1915. Three men nearby
were killed, and two wounded. The laborer himself
was turned over, covered with earth, and stunned. He could
hardly get up. He was carried to shelter and found paralyzed
on the left side, and unable to speak.</p>

<p>Next day, he was carried to the ambulance, and hemianesthesia
was found to exist in addition to the hemiplegia. He
could now speak with some difficulty and stammered. Vision
and hearing were also impaired on the left side. Reflexes
weak; no sign of wound. There was a convulsive crisis of
some sort during the day, and afterwards the man complained
of a violent headache, whereupon a lumbar puncture showed
a clear fluid and a marked excess of albumin by the heat test.</p>

<p>The following day, March 6, the patient had much improved;
his hemiplegia was less marked and the arm paralysis
had almost entirely disappeared. He still stammered.</p>

<p>Upon the next day, vision and hearing were normal, and
the sensation was practically normal. A second lumbar
puncture, March 8, showed a diminution in the amount of
albumin, although it was still supernormal.</p>

<p>March 9, leg contractured in extension; stammering.</p>

<p>March 12, there was no evidence of disease. March 13,
albumin was very slightly increased over the normal in the
puncture fluid. March 16, there was a slight trace only of
weakness in the left leg. The urine was throughout normal.
The patient wrote <i>Bavo</i> April 12, and May 7 he was well but
still felt heaviness and pulling sensations.</p>

<p>July 15 it was reported at Tours that he was not yet well,

thorax on the left side and received an injection of antitetanic
serum. A few days later, May 18, 1915, he came on hospital
service very sick, with high temperature and marked suppuration.
The next day he had an anxious facies, temperature
of 40 degrees, and sharp pains in the left arm. This
arm May 21 was still very painful and then began to make
involuntary movements in the shape of incessant clonic
contractions. The forearm would suddenly flex upon the
upper arm, and the upper arm itself would violently push itself
forward and outward. Meantime, the wrist and fingers
were not involved in the contractions. The movements were
continuous, but paroxysmally increased in extent.</p>

<p>Babinski, called in consultation, confirmed the diagnosis of
an anomalous form of tetanus. Next day trismus, pleurosthotonos,

<p>Paralysis of right leg: Hysterical? Organic?
“Micro-organic?”</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 410.</b> (<span class="smcap">Von Sarbo</span>, January, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A Lieutenant, aged 28, lost consciousness September 6,
1914, as the result of a shell explosion. When consciousness
returned in the hospital, he could not remember what had
happened. The last he remembered was that he had been
pushing forward with his troop. There had been no psychic
shock whatever. Examined September 15, he showed a
right-sided hemiplegia with stiffness of the right lower extremity
so that it could not be even passively flexed. It was
with difficulty he could walk and he dragged his right foot.
Patellar reflex could not be elicited on the right. Oppenheim
and Babinski were absent. There was a slight nystagmus on
looking to the right. Pupils normal. Tongue deviated to
the left. Speech was slow and the man had to think a little
over some expressions. He could not feel touch so well
on the right as on the left and this hypesthesia grew more
marked distally. He was greatly bothered because certain
words did not come to him readily, especially names.</p>

<p>The absence of the Babinski and Oppenheim reflexes was
against an organic hypothesis and the absence of hysterical
stigmata and the non-characteristic sensory disorder, as well
as the absence of any psychic shock in the history, spoke
against hysteria. The hypoglossus paralysis spoke in favor
of the organic nature of the disease.</p>

<p>According to von Sarbo we must look for the background
of so-called functional nervous disorders, hysteria and
neurasthenia, in structural changes of the nervous system,
the changes that Charcot called molecular. But the lesions,
he believes, do not lead to a degeneration of neurons. Accordingly
we get only the external form of organic paralysis
without concomitant symptoms, such as Oppenheim and
Babinski reflexes. Von Sarbo terms his hypothesis that of
“microörganic” changes. To prove the hysterical nature of
a condition we must show first that the symptoms have taken
their rise on a mental or moral basis.</p>

</div>

<h4><b>Case 411.</b> (<span class="smcap">Léri</span>, <span class="smcap">Froment</span> and <span class="smcap">Mahar</span>, July, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A big shell burst October 3, 1914, a little over 3 meters
from a soldier crouching in a shallow Saint Mihiel trench.
The shell made a hole two meters in diameter and 1.5 meters
deep, and covered the man with loose earth, from which he
was readily released. During the next few days, the man
found difficulty in following his comrades on short marches
(1 to 4 kilometers). He was unable to buckle on his knapsack.
The patient was himself not alarmed at his condition.</p>

<p>Up to the time of his accident, this man, a farmer, had never
had any motor trouble, nor was there any nervous disorder
in any of his relatives. He had been in several conflicts,
August 24-25, September 4-6, in the Argonne and in the
Haute Meuse, and he had never found it hard to keep up with
his comrades. In fact, once in the Haute Meuse, he took part
in an exceedingly difficult and hasty retreat, and only a week
before the shell-shock above described he had put in a very
long march. Thus a man, perfectly normal before the shock,
had fallen into a general state of slight muscular paralysis.</p>

<p>On the third day very suddenly this paralysis became complete.
The wounded man, while sitting in the trench, found
that he could not stand up either with or without the use of
his hands. Now, that very morning he had marched three
kilometers from his cantonment to the trench. He was supported
on the way to the relief post, hardly 200 meters away,
and was then sent to the hospital at Bar-le-Duc. At this
time he was so weak that he had to be fed like a child.</p>

<p>For a period of three weeks he lay, unable to rise or sit up.
There was one exception to the generalization of the paresis:
the movements of the head and neck were normal. A general
muscular atrophy set in during the three months, but gradually
diminished in amount. The diagnosis of myopathy was
made, based upon the evident degree of lumbar wasting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[574]</a></span>
kyphosis, the man’s attitude, gait, manner of rising, galvanotonic
contractions.</p>

<p>The history was, of course, rather against the diagnosis of
myopathy, as well as the marked atrophy of the hands and
the existence of an incomplete R. D. Moreover the fact that
he improved may be regarded as rendering the diagnosis of
myopathy doubtful.</p>

<p>Other diagnoses, less likely than that of myopathy, may
be considered,&mdash;hematomyelia, recurrent traumatic poliomyelitis
affecting the anterior horns, polyneuritis.</p>

<p>Without making decision as to the nature of this case, Léri
proposes the question whether there is a shell-shock myopathy
and whether there is a myopathy due to gas or to
hemorrhage?</p>

</div>

<h4><b>Case 412.</b> (<span class="smcap">Dejerine</span>, February, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A territorial infantryman, 36, of a nervous and impressionable
temperament (father alcoholic), was blown up by a
bomb October 3, 1914, between Bapaume and Arras. He
was evacuated forthwith to the relief post. According to his
own story, he spat blood, could not talk, and felt his right
side weak. He was three weeks at a hospital in Paimpol,
with the diagnosis of right hemiplegia with contracture and
mutism. At Guingamp, an electrical treatment was followed
by a gradual disappearance of the arm contracture.</p>

<p>Examined by Dejerine, January 2, 1915, he was found
to be a tall, stalwart man with right leg contractured in
extension, foot in equinovarus, heel raised. He walked,
dragging the leg, which trembled; the trembling then extended
to the rest of the body. In dorsal decubitus, the
leg lay in adduction and internal rotation. He could lift
the leg only 5 cm. above the bed, could only slightly flex leg
on thigh, and could not at all flex thigh on hip. The leg
could not be bent at all if he was requested to hold it stiff.
Ankle joint movements were impossible from contracture.
The equinovarus was in contracture which could not be
corrected. Right hip movements were limited and painful.
Muscular atrophy absent.</p>

<p>Whereas on the left side plantar stimulation produced not
only the normal flexor reflex but also the classical defense
movements of flexion of leg on thigh and thigh on hip,&mdash;on
the right side neither a needle nor a match, nor any other
form of stimulation of the sole, produced any kind of reaction
on the part of the toes, the fascia lata, or any leg muscles.
Tested every day for some weeks, the result was always the
same. The cremasteric reflex was weak on the affected side.
Abolition of the plantar reflex and of the defense movements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[576]</a></span>
on the right side was associated with an anesthesia and a
hypesthesia of the right side of the body, involving complete
anesthesia below the knee and hypesthesia of superficial
and deep sensation above the knee. The buccal and lingual
mucous membranes were also hypesthetic. The bony sensibility
was lost in the foot and lower leg, and was diminished
in all of the bones of the right side of the body. There was no
contraction of the visual fields. The right corneal reflex was
diminished. There were no other sensory defects.</p>

<p>The man was also aphonic, being unable to utter a word or
a sound except a jerky whistling sound like the letting off
of steam. He was able to write out his history intelligently.
He was very emotional, wept, and trembled all over when
talking of wife and children. The spinal puncture fluid was in
all respects normal. A laryngoscopic examination showed
that the vocal cords were functioning normally. The long
<i>a</i> could be pronounced distinctly, at the expense of great
effort so that the larynx would finally be blocked. The
laryngeal reflex was abolished. The laryngeal mucosa could
be touched with a probe without producing the slightest pain
or coughing reflex. By way of treatment, this case of hysterotraumatism
was given isolation and psychotherapy
for two months without effect. But about the middle of
March he began to get better, the symptoms rapidly faded,
cure was effected at the end of March, and the man was
evacuated to his dépôt.</p>

<p>Shell-shock: Tic VERSUS spasm.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 413.</b> (<span class="smcap">Meige</span>, July, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A soldier was bowled over in a trench by a big shell that
burst nearby. He lost consciousness and was carried to the
ambulance. But he came to, and was so absolutely well with
a few hours’ rest that he took part in a lively attack shortly
thereafter and got a wound in the left arm, affecting slightly
the ulnar nerve. He was sent to the Salpêtrière for this ulnar
nerve affection, when certain movements of his scalp were incidentally
noted.</p>

<p>The scalp movements were quick, affecting the fronto-occipitalis
muscles as well as the auricular muscles. The displacement
was from behind forward, and then from before
backward, with slight oscillations of the ear; and at the same
time, the forehead wrinkled or became smooth. The movement
was involuntary and more convulsive than the somewhat
similar movements that many persons can execute with
scalp and ears. The phenomenon appeared after the shock
for the first time. He had not noticed it himself but the
physician at the ambulance had called his attention to it.
The soldier was not disturbed by the matter, either at that
time or later.</p>

<p>The diagnostician would consider, on the one hand, tic,
and on the other, spasm. According to Meige, the man was
a victim of tic. No case of such limited spasm appears to
have been observed previously. However, the sudden development
of these movements without previous history of tic
renders the diagnosis somewhat doubtful. There was also a
complete anesthesia to pin-prick in the present case over the
whole right side of the scalp, face, and neck, even passing
below to involve the chest, shoulder, back, and upper part
of the right arm, with hypesthesia decreasing toward the
nipple and the elbow. The soldier was quite ignorant of
this sensory disorder and had never before been examined
for sensations. The examination was made with due precautions
to avoid suggestion. The question of anastomosis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[578]</a></span>
between the facial nerve and the auriculo-temporal branch
of the trigeminus and the auricular branch of the cervical
plexus, and of their relations to the anesthesia and tic of this
case, is raised.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> pathological movements such as tremors, tics, and
choreiform movements, Roussy and Lhermitte divide the
tremors (see also under <a href="#case337">Case 337</a>) into typical and atypical.</p>

<p>The atypical ones are either limited, or more usually
generalized when they are merely parts of the Shell-shock
syndrome. Sometimes the tremors are paroxysmal, aggravated
by noises. Now and then, a condition of tremophobia
appears (see <a href="#case225">Case 225</a>). As for the typical tremors, see
classifications under <a href="#case337">Case 337</a>.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> tics, the tonic or postural tic is, according to Roussy
and Lhermitte, much less common than clonic or spasmodic
movements, which are Shell-shock phenomena like tremors
and usually yield to psychotherapy if treated early. These
tics are usually observed in and about the head, involving
the sternomastoid, trapezius, and platysma muscles to produce
clonic contractions of the neck. Other tics involve
coarser head movements, nodding, eyelid and facial spasms,
bilateral or unilateral, and shoulder movements. Babinski
has suggested that some of the tremors are possibly due to
organic disease, in view of the fact that they are not readily
influenced by psychotherapy. Meige has suggested that
some of the tics may also be in some sense organic. As for
the differential diagnosis of tremor and tic, according to
Roussy and Lhermitte, the Shell-shock onset may be an indicator.
The non-rhythmic and irregular nature of the tic
movements, and their exaggeration on voluntary movement,
may be of some importance. Most of the tremors appear
to be attended by a certain degree of permanent contraction
of the muscle groups concerned. Tremors cease when these
contractions disappear.</p>

<p>A point in treatment is that complete muscular relaxation
should be obtained by having the patient open his mouth and
breathe deeply.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> diagnosis of neurasthenia in this case, it may be
inquired whether the term is properly used, and whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[579]</a></span>
there is not some confusion here betwixt neurasthenia and
hysteria.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> hyperalgesia, Myers states that about 25 per cent of
his Shell-shock cases have shown a variety of disorders of
the skin sense. Hyperesthesia and over-reaction is one phenomenon
in the list, but is far less common than hyperesthesia.
According to Myers, the hyperesthesia was more
relative than absolute, and was probably due to increased
affective response.</p>

<p>August, 1915, between Ypres and Flamentières, a Jack
Johnson exploded one day about three o’clock in the morning
near an experienced gunner, who had been on service in the
R. F. A. for 15 years, and in France during the present war
10 months. He came to in the military hospital at Chatham,
two weeks later, and was told he was lucky to be there at all
as the shell had killed many comrades. He was transferred
to Colchester, and thence to the Fourth London General
Hospital.</p>

<p>Sitting in a chair, the man showed continuous rhythmic
movements of legs, hands, and jaw, exaggerated when he was
spoken to. The tremor was almost a clonic spasm. Every
now and then, the patient would start and look sidewise and
upwards, as if a shell were about to drop. Hyperacusis was
such that the firing of the guns as far off as Woolwich alarmed
him. In telling his story, he would repeat the same words
over and over. He dreamt of shells bursting. His sleep was
disturbed with groaning and moaning. The face was flushed,
and the palms sweating. Because of the constant tremor, he
could not stand or walk without assistance, and it was difficult
to test reflexes. The tremor somewhat resembled the
intention tremor of multiple sclerosis. He was unable to
feel the prick of the needle on legs, left arm, or hand. He
could not feel vibrations of the tuning-fork on feet, legs, or
hands, though he could on the forehead. The fork was
heard quite well six inches from the ears. There was some
difficulty in recognizing colors. Bitter fluids could be tasted,
but vinegar, salt, and various fluids, could not be recognized.
He could not recognize tincture of assafetida, attar of roses,
or oil of cloves, though nitrite of amyl, ammonia and glacial
acetic acid were recognized.</p>

<p>Major Mott felt that, though this prolonged severe disease
in a long-service man might possibly be related to some organic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[581]</a></span>
change in the brain, he might well treat him by suggestion.
Major Mott told him that the careful examination
just made showed that there was no organic disease, and made
it certain that he would recover. In a fortnight, he sat in a
chair without tremors and with a profound belief in Major
Mott.</p>

<h4><b>Case 415.</b> (<span class="smcap">MacCurdy</span>, July, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A private, 25, something of a liar and of rather a low personality,
had enlisted in the regular army in 1911, but deserted
to become a football player. He reënlisted, and went
to France in September, 1914, enjoying the first six months.
He broke his ankles by falling into a deep dug-out, and got
frost-bite. After three or four months in England, he found
that he did not wish to go back to France. He was two
months in barracks, and then went up the line in a good deal
of a panic. Soon after, he was wounded in the thigh and was
able to remain in hospital a fortnight, exposed, however, to
shell-fire and given to starting at noise and occasional war
dreams. Sent to his base, he remained jumpy and was now
permanently afraid of the line. After three weeks in the
trenches, he again got wounds, spent five months in England,
came back to France in May, and fought till September, 1916.
He tried to convince the medical officer that he had appendicitis
and trench fever.</p>

<p>About the middle of September he saw with horror a man
crushed by a tank, and thereafter was markedly affected by
the sight of blood. Another slight wound sent him to a rest
camp for two weeks, whence he was again thrown into the
line, suffering acutely from fear and horror of blood. In
three days he fractured his left collarbone and wrist. He gave
a pint and a half of blood for transfusion purposes, and in
turn was shipped to England. On removal of the splint, he
found “probably not without satisfaction” that the arm
was paralyzed. It remained paralyzed for five months, until
treatment in a special hospital eventually cured the arm;
but upon cure of the arm, nightmares developed,&mdash;an indication,
according to MacCurdy, of the strong resistance he
felt to the idea of returning to the front.</p>

<p>Neurasthenic hyperalgesia after peripheral nerve
injury.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 416.</b> (<span class="smcap">Weygandt</span>, January, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A German volunteer, a sportsman, was under heavy shell
fire after the middle of October, 1914, and was wounded in
the upper arm in November, with an injury to the median
nerve that occasioned severe pain. These strictly localized
pains increased upon any sort of physical or mental strain.
If he walked down steps he kept thinking he might have an
accident, and then the pains set in with greater force. He
became apathetic so that he did not eat, drink or urinate.
If his head were touched he felt pain as if from an electric
shock. He also felt the pain when he saw anybody approaching
a door to close it, through apprehension of the noise.
Meantime, the wound was well healed. The pulse was accelerated.
The visual fields were only slightly contracted.
The patient wanted to get well and go back to the service.</p>

<p>Weygandt regards this hyperalgesia after peripheral nerve
injuries as neurasthenic.</p>

<h4><b>Case 417.</b> (<span class="smcap">Shufflebotham</span>, April, 1915.)</h4>

<p>Among fourteen cases of lead poisoning, members of the
territorial forces, largely from North Staffordshire, was a
patient suffering from peripheral neuritis. He had been in
the dipping-house. Two years before going into the service
he had been suspended for lead poisoning by the factory
surgeon. Giving up his work at the pottery, he became a
general laborer in a non-lead process factory.</p>

<p>Three weeks after enlistment, the man began to complain
of pains, tenderness in the arms, weakness of the wrists,
headache, giddiness, nausea, and constipation. The bowels
were opened by a large dose of epsom salts. On blood examination
the hemoglobin was found diminished 40 per cent;
cells with basophilic granules were found to the number of
500 per cu. mm. The face was characteristically pasty.
There was albuminuria. Alcohol could be excluded. The
man had to be discharged.</p>

<p>All Shufflebotham’s cases occurred from three to seven
weeks after mobilization, nor have any cases ever been reported
in territorials after their annual training. Constipation
was invariable. In two cases returned to service,
there was a recurrent attack. An epidemic could be excluded.
Shufflebotham suggests that the altered conditions
of life, especially the marching and drilling, caused increased
metabolism, setting free lead compounds from the muscles
and organs of the body. It is true that a glost placer always
works very hard with his muscles, but not with the muscles
used by the soldier.</p>

<h4><b>Case 418.</b> (<span class="smcap">Cargill</span>, February, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A Naval Service man, 20, was thought to have peripheral
neuritis. A long history of pain and numbness in arms and
legs, a well-marked analgesia and anesthesia over the anterior

could be thrust without pain into the anesthetic areas. When
told to say <i>yes</i> when the pin was felt, and <i>no</i> when it was not
felt, the man persistently said <i>no</i> when the areas noted
above were touched. The deep reflexes were normal. Faradism
by wire brush at two sittings yielded a complete cure.

<p>Multiple wounds; signs of late tetanus 7-8 weeks

weeks after trauma. Dysentery. Recovery.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 419.</b> (<span class="smcap">Bouquet</span>, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A soldier invalided for endocarditis July 8, 1908, went
back to the colors on his own request August 8, 1914. He was
wounded at noon September 6, 1914, in the attack at Abbaye
Woods. He lay in the woods, with several comrades as
badly wounded as himself, until September 10, eating berries
and drinking rain water. He had five wounds in all; in
left lower leg, thigh, left external malleolus, right calf, and
left forearm. Moreover, he had dysentery.</p>

<p>He was picked up by the Germans September 10 and
carried by them to the ambulance at Saint André, where he
was given belated first dressing. When the enemy retreated
September 12 he was left behind and finally carried back
September 13 into the French lines by a French physician
who had been a prisoner likewise. A second dressing was
given September 14 at Rambluzin. He was then carried in a
sanitary train to Bar-sur-Aube, where, September 15, injection
of antitetanic serum was given. He left Bar-sur-Aube
on December 18, 1914, practically cured, though one
of the wounds still needed care. The dysentery was still
present and walking was difficult. He was then cared for
at Auxiliary Hospital No. 102 in Paris.</p>

<p>It seems that about six weeks after his entrance in the
hospital at Bar-sur-Aube he had had some difficulty in
opening his jaws, with acute pains at the temporomaxillary
joint. Similar pains appeared a few days later in the neck,
with a sensation of stiffening. The jaws still opened easily
enough December 18, yet the man got pains in his jaws as soon
as he began to speak. The pain and contracture in the neck
region were sharp and permanent. Sometimes the contracture
got more marked, and the board-like muscles could
be felt stiffening under the examining finger. During such
crises the patient had to lie or sit down. Sometimes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[587]</a></span>
pains descended below the shoulders along the vertebral
column. The crises occurred more often in the night, in bed.</p>

<p>The diagnosis of late tetanus was made, and alcohol rubs
were given. The phenomena gradually disappeared. The
dysentery also had not yielded to therapeutics until eight or
ten days before the patient left the hospital. There was
still, at the time of report, a certain difficulty in walking, with
a tendency to use the external border of the left foot rather
than the sole.</p>

<p>At the time of admission to hospital he complained of great
irritability, nervous twitching, formication in his limbs, war

The muscles of lower extremities were attacked by tonic
spasms, and felt board-like. This tonic spasm occurred on
each attempt at motion, very gradually disappearing when at
rest. Passive movements also had the same effect. Fibrillary
tremor affected the left quadriceps. On each attempt at
motion, pains were felt in the legs. At first the cramps were
so severe that all locomotion or even standing was impossible.</p>

<h4><b>Case 421.</b> (<span class="smcap">Babinski</span>, 1916.)</h4>

<p>The forearm of a soldier was pierced in its lower part by a
bullet, which produced no lesion of large nerve trunks or
blood vessels. A complete brachial monoplegia followed.
Every movement of the different segments of the arm was
abolished. The hand and forearm were slightly atrophied,
and were of a reddish salmon color. The temperature of the
affected hand and forearm was about three or four degrees
lower than that on the other side. The sphygmometric oscillations
of the forearm were twice as small in the paralyzed
limb as in the healthy limb, but the systolic blood pressure
was normal. There was a mechanical over-excitability of
the muscles, and a slight exaggeration of the bone and tendon
reflexes. The paralysis was in part of reflex (physiopathic)
nature. On account however, of the completeness of
the monoplegia, and the fact that the reflex paralyses as a
rule affect only the distal portion of the limb, the diagnosis
of hysteria had to be made in addition to the diagnosis of
reflex disorder.</p>

was of a hysterical nature.</p>

<p>Slight bullet wound of hand: Flaccid paralysis with
vasomotor and thermic disorder. A case “non-organic”
in the ordinary sense and non-hysterical,
<i>i.e.</i>, reflex or physiopathic.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 422.</b> (<span class="smcap">Babinski</span> and <span class="smcap">Froment</span>, 1917.)</h4>

<p>Struck by his observations upon the persistence of tendon
reflexes in narcosis in a wounded soldier, Babinski continued
observations in the same general direction in a case which
may be termed briefly one of hypotonia of the extensors of
the hand following the passage of a bullet through the arm
without nerve trunk lesion.</p>

<p>This patient had flaccid paralysis of hand and fingers following
wound in second dorsal interosseous space and vasomotor
disorder and local hypothermia in the hand. There was
a slight diffuse atrophy of the muscles of the hand, forearm,
and arm; but this atrophy was not systematized, and there
was no R. D. The tendon reflexes of the extremity were
preserved. There were no signs of organic disease of the
central or peripheral nervous system; that is, in the ordinary
sense of these terms.</p>

<p>Was it a question of hysteria or of simulation?</p>

<p>Babinski was struck by the following symptoms:</p>

<p>First, the remarkably intense hypotonia, especially noteworthy
in the thumb, a hypotonia quite equal if not superior
to that observed in paralysis following marked nerve
lesions;</p>

<p>Second, mechanical over-excitability of high degree in the
muscles of the hand and forearm, with retardation of the
muscular response; and</p>

<p>Third, electric over-excitability of the muscles, with what
Babinski calls “anticipated fusion” of the faradic reactions.</p>

<p>It appears that this patient had been wounded in September,
1914, and that the paralysis had developed five
months later. Before the development of this paralysis,
there had been simply a meiopragic state.</p>

<p>Without perforating the hand, the bullet had remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[593]</a></span>
in the wound, being excised therefrom three months after
the trauma.</p>

<p>In January, 1916,&mdash;that is, some sixteen months after
the injury and eleven months after the recovery of the paralysis,&mdash;the
vasomotor disorder and the hypothermia, and
the faradic, voltaic and mechanical over-excitability of the
hand and forearm muscles, were in evidence. Hypotonia
was marked, permitting an overflexion of the hand upon the
forearm. If the patient moved his forearm, the affected
hand would hang and oscillate inertly; likewise in walking,
seeming to obey only the laws of physics.</p>

<p>In May, 1916, the patient was invalided and found to be
still in possession of the above-mentioned signs. Similar
phenomena have been found in the <i>main figée</i> acrocontracture,
and <i>main d’accoucheur</i>, and belong, in the opinion of Babinski,
to a group which is neither hysterical nor organic in the
ordinary sense of the terms. Vasomotor and thermic phenomena
are in the foreground of the picture, and are, in fact,
practically constant, though they vary somewhat in degree.
They react abnormally to the temperature of the surrounding
medium; there is undoubtedly a local perturbation of
the vasomotor and heat-regulating mechanism. There is
also certain evidence of vascular spasm. The vasomotor and
thermic disorders run parallel with the mechanical over-excitability
of the muscles and the slowness of the response.</p>

<p>Chloroform to demonstrate asymmetry of reflexes.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 423.</b> (<span class="smcap">Babinski</span> and <span class="smcap">Froment</span>, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A soldier, 26, sustained, September 22, 1914, a bullet injury
of the right calf. There was no fracture, as X-ray
showed, but healing was slow, taking no less than three
months. The right knee-jerk was a little stronger and a
little sharper than the left, but the difference was controversial;
and the difference between the two Achilles reflexes
was still more doubtful.</p>

<p>Chloroformed October 10, 1915: As the patient was going
to sleep, even before the phase of excitation and motor agitation
had passed, the two knee-jerks and left Achilles jerk
had disappeared. They grew rapidly less marked before
disappearing, and none of the tendon reflexes presented any
phase of exaggeration while the patient was going under.
At this point anesthesia was arrested. The right Achilles
reflex, which had not disappeared, was sharply defined. It
was even stronger than in the normal state and polykinetic.
During the whole phase of awaking from the chloroform, the
right Achilles reflex remained strong and polykinetic, without,
however, any ankle clonus. Thus, the difference between
the two Achilles reflexes became indisputable; also the right
knee-jerk reappeared before the left, and became stronger
without any patellar clonus. At this time, the difference
between the two knee-jerks was sharp and beyond cavil.
This status, in which the knee-jerk and Achilles reflexes were
asymmetrical, lasted about ten minutes after anesthesia
ceased and lasted a little longer for the knee-jerks than for
the Achilles jerks.</p>

<p>Reflexes under chloroform.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 424.</b> (<span class="smcap">Babinski</span> and <span class="smcap">Froment</span>, October, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A soldier sustained a clean-cut wound of the supero-external
aspect of the right thigh without much destruction
of tissue or any adherent scar. He showed marked lameness,
September 15, 1915, walking with his right leg extended and
the foot in external rotation. There was a slight limitation
of the movements of the hip joint in respect to internal rotation
and flexion of thigh. The right knee-jerk was a little
stronger than the left, and this condition persisted several
days. After a few tests, the knee-jerk became even slightly
polykinetic. The Achilles jerks were normal and equal.
There was no epileptoid trepidation of the foot, and no patella
clonus. There was a slight hypothermia of right leg,
with ill-defined muscular atrophy. Walking caused pain.</p>

<p>Chloroform anesthesia, September 20, 1915, yielded an
exaggeration of the knee-jerks with a suggestion of patella
clonus even before the phase in anesthesia of motor excitation
had set in. As anesthesia proceeded the exaggeration was
rapidly lost on the left side but progressively increased on
the right. In the phase of complete muscular resolution,
when all the other tendon reflexes (such as the knee-jerk,
Achilles jerk on the left side, the radial and olecranon reflexes
on the left side) were abolished, the patella clonus on
the right side was perfectly distinct and could be elicited
either by the usual method or by raising the thigh and letting
it fall. On percussion of the patella tendon, a strong polykinetic
reflex was obtained; right Achilles jerk preserved;
right leg in external rotation. Internal rotation could be
passively performed better than in the waking state, but
this movement was still limited. As the man was waking
from anesthesia, when reflexes were reappearing, there was
a suggestion of left patella clonus&mdash;right clonus as strong as
before. At no time any trepidation of the foot. The patella
clonus on the right side lasted an hour after waking, at which
time all the reflexes returned to their previous state.</p>

<h4><b>Case 425.</b> (<span class="smcap">Babinski</span> and <span class="smcap">Froment</span>, October, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A soldier sustained a bullet wound, September 22, 1914,
in the right calf. There was no fracture, as X-ray showed.
Cicatrization was slow and took at least three months. He
was examined October 2, 1915, at the Pitié,&mdash;not complaining
of pains, but lame. There were no pains, limitation of
movement, or joint sounds in the hip joint, and X-ray was
negative. There was a slight atrophy of the limb, 1.5 c.m.
less in circumference on the right. There was a sharply defined
local hypothermia of the right leg up to the knee. The
right knee-jerk was a little stronger and brisker than the
left, yet it was difficult to be sure of this, and there was a
still more doubtful difference between the Achilles reflexes.</p>

<p>The man was anesthetized with chloroform, October 10.
As he was going to sleep, before the phase of excitement and
agitation had ceased, the two knee-jerks had disappeared.
At the same time, the left Achilles jerk vanished, followed by
the plantar cutaneous reflexes. Anesthesia was then stopped.
The right Achilles jerk, which had not disappeared at any
time, remained distinct. It was stronger than in the waking
state, and polykinetic. During the waking phase, this reflex
remained strong and polykinetic, but there was no epileptoid
trepidation of the foot. Accordingly, under chloroform,
the difference of the two Achilles reflexes had become very
sharp. The right knee-jerk reappeared before the left and
became stronger, though without patella clonus. This difference
was much more striking than in the waking state.
This asymmetry of the patella and Achilles reflexes lasted
about 10 minutes after anesthesia was stopped, and lasted
a little longer for the patella reflexes than for the Achilles
reflexes.</p>

</div>

<h4><b>Case 426.</b> (<span class="smcap">Babinski</span> and <span class="smcap">Froment</span>, 1916.)</h4>

<p>Babinski speaks of certain symptomatic incompatibilities
which emerged in the study of cases of combinations of
hysteria, organic nervous disease, and the so-called physiopathic
disorders. An example of such an incompatibility
might be that of a patient who should, three months after a
sudden hemiplegia, show complete or almost complete flaccid
paralysis and but slight exaggeration of tendon reflexes&mdash;yet
the Babinski reflex. Of course, the Babinski reflex would
permit a diagnosis of pyramidal tract disease. Yet a sudden
intense hemiplegia lasting three months, if it were merely
a matter of pyramidal tract disorder, ought to show hyperreflexia
of a pronounced degree as well as contracture. An
example from the arm is as follows:</p>

<p>A soldier got a shrapnel wound in the left supraclavicular
region, and had a complete paralysis of the arm, which had
lasted more than a month. Electrical examination showed
marked reaction of degeneration in the muscles controlled
by the musculo-cutaneous nerve, as well as a diminution of
electrical excitability in the muscles innervated by radial
branches. On the contrary, in the circumflex territory, ulnar
and median, electrical excitability was normal. There were
no vasomotor disorders. The diagnosis of an association of
hysteria and organic disease was made. Babinski affirmed
that electrification would effect a partial cure; and in point of
fact, the patient, after having submitted to the current for
several minutes, was able to use all the muscles whose faradic
contractility was normal or almost normal. Thus, he could
raise his arm, flex the thumb, flex the fingers, close the hand,
and extend the hand and fingers. Flexion of the forearm on
the arm was still difficult, since there was, in fact, a reaction
of degeneration in the muscles of the anterior region of the
arm. The fact that the movements could be partially executed
was dependent upon action of the supinator longus.</p>

<p>Gunshot fracture of upper arm; recovery with
motor power in five weeks: Six weeks later, Erb’s
palsy (plus). Hypothesis: “Reflex paralysis” preferred.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 427.</b> (<span class="smcap">Oppenheim</span>, January, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A reservist, 26, was shot through the middle of the left
upper arm, sustaining an oblique fracture of the humerus,
August 26. The external wounds healed in a month; the
fracture somewhat later. The left arm was at first stiff and
motionless, but in five weeks it could again be moved. Pains
disappeared with return of motility.</p>

<p>About the middle of November the arm began to lose power
to move again, especially the muscles of the upper arm.
November 20, the patient showed atrophic paralysis (left
deltoid, biceps, brachialis internus, and supinator longus)
suggesting at first glance the appearance of an Erb’s palsy;
but the triceps and the adductor of the upper arm were also
unable to move and there was a slight paresis in the distal
muscles of the extremity. There were no pains or other objective
disorders.</p>

<p>The diagnosis of subacute poliomyelitis was considered.
Electric excitability, however, was found to be normal, both
faradically and galvanically.</p>

<p>When patient walked, the left arm swung helpless without
sign of innervation or any tonus. Abduction of the shoulder
could also not be performed, though a slight flexion of the
forearm shortly began to be demonstrable. If the patient
inclined his head to the right, extended his hand at the wrist,
and flexed the fingers forcibly, he could then flex the forearm
somewhat, and a slight tension of the biceps and supinator
longus developed. Sometimes fibrillary tremors developed
in deltoid and biceps.</p>

<p>Of course a transient peripheral palsy can be produced by
pressure of the radial nerve without any change of electrical
excitability, but such a change is not associated with atrophy.</p>

<p>Neuritis and poliomyelitis producing an Erb’s palsy without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[599]</a></span>
any effect upon the electrical reactions is an hypothesis not
to be entertained.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the hypothesis of psychogenic or hysterical
palsy may be set up. Yet an atonic atrophic palsy with loss
of tendon reflexes (supinator) is inappropriate. According
to Oppenheim, this case falls into the category of the arthrogenic
atrophies. A simple muscular atrophy may follow
disease of joints and bones. However, such cases have rarely
shown a complete palsy, as in Oppenheim’s case.</p>

<p>In short, we return to the old doctrine of reflex paralysis,
conceiving that a stimulus passing from the periphery influences
the gray matter in its trophic functions.</p>

<p>How much effect had the psyche upon this condition? The
patient had stuttered from childhood and had sustained a
fracture of the skull at 9, following which his school work,
especially mental arithmetic, had been poor. The lack of
psychic inhibitions may play some part in the situation, but
on the whole, the reflex hypothesis is preferred by Oppenheim,
the nerve conceived to be dynamically affected, the
muscles organically.</p>

<p>Paralysis: Hysterical? organic?</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 428.</b> (<span class="smcap">Gougerot</span> and <span class="smcap">Charpentier</span>, May, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A soldier, 20, was wounded May 15, 1915, by a large number
of shell fragments, 15 of which struck the right leg, two
producing serious injuries,&mdash;the one, a penetrating wound of
the popliteal space followed by stiffness of the knee, later cured
by extraction of the fragments; the other, causing a deep
wound at the internal malleolus. The fragment was extracted
June 3, but osteomyelitis persisted and a fistulous
contraction was developed in January, 1916. There was a
slight equinism.</p>

<p>By contrast with these deep bony lesions of the right leg,
on the left side a fragment had struck the dorsum of the left
foot at about its middle point, along the extensors of the
fourth and fifth toes. The fragment was removed toward the
end of June, 1915. The wound closed in a fortnight, leaving a
loose 20 mm. scar. The man complained of pains, which he
called electrical, in the third and fourth toes, if one bore down
on this scar, a symptom suggesting that the dorsal nerves had
been injured. Immediately after the wound both legs had
been paralyzed, according to the soldier. He had been able
only to drag himself along on his shoulders. This indeterminate
paralysis lasted three days. It may have been hystero-traumatic,
or it may have been a sort of diffuse inhibition.
Just after the injury, the left foot was in contracture, which
gave place a month later to paralysis. Only the great toe
was still able to move a little. In December, 1915, the
patient still could extend and flex the toes on the left side
very badly, though he could execute movements easily on
the right side. There was no stiffness of joints; there were
no tendon reflex disorders. There were no trophic vasomotor
or secretory disturbances.</p>

<p>The diagnosis of hysterical paresis seemed warranted, but
electrical examination showed that the troubles were organic.
There was an increase in the faradic and galvanic excitability
of the external popliteal nerve. The response was more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[601]</a></span>
sudden than normal, and there was an increase in faradic and
galvanic excitability in the tibialis anticus. There was a
decrease of faradic and galvanic excitability in the extensor
communis of the toes and in the external peroneus.</p>

<p>Thus, this patient after being wounded in both feet May
15, 1915, paralyzed in both feet for a period of three days,
undergoing a contracture of the left foot for a month, giving
place to paralysis of foot and toes, with slow improvement
from the end of July, 1915, was still in this latter state in
March, 1916; though without trophic disorder, he showed
faradic and galvanic over-excitability of the external popliteal
nerve and of the tibialis anticus, <i>pari passu</i> with diminished
electrical excitability for other muscles.</p>

</div>

<h4><b>Case 429.</b> (<span class="smcap">Gougerot</span> and <span class="smcap">Charpentier</span>, May, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A man was wounded Oct. 11, 1914, on the back of the
right hand. Two hours later, he was attended at the relief
post. At this time, his hand was straight, with fingers extended.
He said that he could not move his fingers, although
there was no pain in them. Three hours after the wound,
the hands swelled and the edema spread as far as the middle
of the forearm. There was a long suppuration, complicated
by lymphangitis. All of the fragments were removed October
26, 1914; healing was complete in three months. The
swelling, however, persisted to June, 1915, and when the
swelling disappeared, the hand began to show drop-wrist.
The wound was sutured between the second and third metacarpals,
and the X-ray showed that the bones had not been
injured, nor had the nerves of the forearm muscles been
touched. The situation was such that the case was catalogued
“functional paralysis.”</p>

<p>October 5, 1915, the hand was still drooping, fingers extended,
and middle finger and ring finger trembling. A
slight stiffness of wrist and fingers did not interfere with
movements. Extension of the wrist could be made very
slightly above horizontal. Flexion was not quite complete,
nor were adduction or abduction. Extension of the fingers
could be performed normally, as well as that of the thumb,
but flexion was not quite complete. There was a slight
palmar retraction. Such were the movements that could be
produced electrically. Voluntarily, flexion of the wrist was
good, abduction and adduction incomplete; extension could
not be executed to the horizontal position. There was a
tendency to flexion of the ring finger. When the patient tried
to flex the middle and index fingers, these fingers trembled but
did not flex. Weak extension and abduction of the thumb
but without opposition could be voluntarily performed;
adduction good; flexion of the first phalanx, weak; of second
phalanx, better. Slight muscular atrophy of the forearm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[603]</a></span>
which was one centimeter less in circumference than the left.
The hand was subject to a general atrophy; the skin reddish
and moist. The X-ray showed a decalcification of all the
bones of the hand and wrist; trophic disturbance of the small
carpal bones although the trauma had affected only the
second interosseous space. No joint lesions or periosteal
thicknesses were found by X-ray. There was a slight hypesthesia
of the palmar surface of the middle finger and of the
index finger. The patient complained of sharp transient pains
in hand and fingers.</p>

<p>In this case, therefore, a wound of the back of the hand
produced an immediate inhibition of muscular action in the
forearm, a rapid edema of the hand and arm, lasting for
eight months and followed by reflex disorders.</p>

<p>There was a considerable diminution in faradic excitability
of the flexor brevis of the thumb, the anterior cubital, the
flexor brevis minimi digiti, and of the dorsal interossei, and
slighter evidence of diminution of galvanic excitability in
some of the muscles.</p>

<p>Sollier is said to have been the first to remark trophic
bone disorders in cases of neuropathic contracture.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> bone changes, Babinski enumerates trophic changes
in the tissue of bones and joints amongst objective signs that
permit us to distinguish the reflex or physiopathic disorders
from the hysterical or pithiatic disorders. Objective signs
of this group (indicators of reflex or physiopathic disorders)
are: (<i>a</i>) Well-marked and persistent vasomotor and thermic
disorder; (<i>b</i>) alterations of muscular tone (either hypotonus,
hypertonus, or a combination of the two); (<i>c</i>) increase
in the mechanical excitability of the muscles and
sometimes nerves; (<i>d</i>) quantitative changes in the electrical
excitability of the muscles, but without R. D.; (<i>e</i>) muscular
atrophy and atrophy of skin, bones, and joints. For cases
of this nature, see especially Cases <a href="#case431">431</a> and <a href="#case432">432</a> of Delherm.</p>

<p>Paralysis: Hysterical? organic?</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 430.</b> (<span class="smcap">Gougerot</span> and <span class="smcap">Charpentier</span>, May, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A man, 22, was wounded September 17, 1914, in the left
hand, the bullet passing from the lower part of the fourth
interosseous space out through the palmar face. The bones
were not injured, and it was evident that only a few nerve
filaments could have been injured; but he had a paralysis
extending far beyond this region, which increased little by
little from November, 1914, to August, 1915. Babinski, examining
him in November, 1914, had made the diagnosis of
psychic paresis of the extensors with diminution of electric
excitability, with a very slight slowing of the contraction of
the last two interossei and the hypothenar eminence, connected
with lesion of the branches of the ulnar nerve. The
disorder spread to the flexors of the fingers and the thumb
muscles. The fifth finger was flexed at rest; there was no
stiffness of joint or tendon retraction. The extensors and
flexors of all the fingers and the thumb, and the abductor of
the thumb showed paresis. The thumb was able to oppose;
the hands were cyanotic. Augmentation of these phenomena
in a period of months, their bizarre distribution, and
the preservation of the opposing power of the thumb suggested
a hystero-organic disease, and Babinski’s notes read,
“Partial and incomplete paralysis of the ulnar nerve, attacking
slightly the hypothenar eminence and the last two
interossei; psychic paresis of the extensors and flexors of
the fingers and thumb and of the abductors of the thumb.”
Electrical examination showed, however, that there was not
only electrical disorder of the common extensors of the
fingers, the extensor proprius of the index and of the ring
fingers, of the long and short extensors of the thumb, but also
there was a considerable diminution to faradic and galvanic
reaction in extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, the radials, the
supinator longus, the pronator teres, the large and small palmar,
the common and superficial flexors of the fingers, the
muscles of the thenar eminence, the anterior ulnar, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[605]</a></span>
anterior biceps and brachial. In short, there was an irradiation
of seemingly organic phenomena in the domain of the
radial, median, and the non-injured part of the cubital
distribution, as well as in the distribution of the musculo-cutaneous.
Apparently, organic paralytic disorder had spread
even to the biceps and had increased over a period of many
months after the wound had healed.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> what he terms <i>organo-hysterical association</i>, Babinski
proposes to distinguish it from hystero-organic association.
In Babinski’s organo-hysterical association, the organic symptoms
are preceded by hysterical symptoms. These cases
of organo-hysterical association,&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, a case in which a
hysterical monoplegia is followed by a musculospiral crutch
paralysis,&mdash;are one of the mainstays of the proof that
hysteria and simulation cannot be confounded. Babinski
concedes that he has sometimes said that hysteria was a
sort of semi-simulation; yet a semi-simulation is not a simulation.</p>

<p>As for Babinski’s <i>hystero-organic association</i>, we here deal
with cases of organic paralysis or contracture in which the
fundamental disorder is organic, and the psychic disorder is
grafted upon it. Both the fundamentally organic and the
fundamentally hysterical associations are instances, according
to Babinski’s phrase, of symptomatic incompatibilities.
In such instances, the hysterical part of the disorder, whether
grafted or original, is dissolved by psychotherapy. There is
a third group of symptomatic incompatibilities, namely,
the <i>hystero-reflex associations</i>, in which, <i>e.g.</i>, a hysterical gait
is combined with vasomotor and thermal disturbances.
There may even be combinations of all three types of disease,
namely, the type of structural disease, of vasomotor disorder,
and of hysteria, in what would then be termed a <i>hystero-reflex-organic
association</i>.</p>

<p>Wound of toes&mdash;Wound of arm: Reflex or physiopathic
paralyses, diagnosis and treatment.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Cases 431 and 432.</b> (<span class="smcap">Delherm</span>, September, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A soldier was wounded in the soft parts of the last two
toes and in the furrow between toes on the left side, September
15, 1914, arriving in the Central Physiotherapeutic Service
of the 17th Army Region, December 27, 1915, left foot in
varus, with marked contracture of tibialis anticus, though
passive movements of flexion, extension, adduction and abduction
were well performed. There was a slight atrophy
of the leg (33 cm. left to 34 cm. right). The scar was a
little painful, and there was a slight degree of hypesthesia of
foot and lower leg. The foot was cold and cyanotic; the reflexes
were normal. An electric examination in the region
of the external popliteal branch of the sciatic nerve showed
that there was no electrical disorder either faradic or voltaic.</p>

<p>Another case was wounded in the right arm by a shell
fragment September 7, 1914, and showed two scars above the
epitrochlea and along the internal border of the triceps.
Examination December 30 showed a normal elbow movement,
pronation and supination, with slight flexion in repose
of the palm of the hand and the fingers. Active flexion
movements of the fingers could be performed only imperfectly,
and the finger pad could only be brought within three
fingers breadths of the palm, despite the greatest effort on the
part of the patient. Minute passive movements were entirely
possible. The fifth finger could not be abducted and
both abduction and adduction of the third and fourth finger
could not be made on account of the nerve lesion. The
thumb was in a condition of contracture which placed it in
abduction in front of the index finger, and the thumb could
not oppose. Passive movements, on the other hand, were
entirely possible. The hand was flexed upon the forearm
through hypertonia of the flexors, which could be easily
overcome with slight but distinct resistance. The hand was
in the position of a radial paralysis. There was a slight degree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[607]</a></span>
of muscular atrophy. Tendon reflexes were normal.
Electric examination showed that stimulation of the ulnar
nerve at the elbow was unable to produce flexion of the last
two fingers or any movement in the hypothenar eminence,
of which the muscles were also not excitable. The interossei
could, however, be made to contract. The median and
radial nerves were normal electrically. The above examinations
were with the faradic current.</p>

<p>With the galvanic current the ulnar nerve proved unexcitable
at the elbow, and the muscles of the hypothenar
eminence contracted more slowly. The median and radial
nerves and their muscles were electrically normal.</p>

<p>In short, there was a complete R. D. of the hypothenar
and partial R. D. of the interossei as a result of the lesion
of the ulnar nerve. There was nothing abnormal in the
other nerves or muscles of the arm. The attitude of radial
pseudoparalysis is due to the contracture of the muscles of
the thenar eminence.</p>

<p>As to therapy, the general movements of flexion of the
fingers, thumb and hand yielded a marked improvement,
but such results cannot be expected in like cases unless a
physician or experienced masseur treats the case. Babinski
and Froment have tried thermotherapy and diathermy
in these cases, finding that the paralysis diminishes and becomes
partial if the limb is warm, although it is important
that it should not become too warm. Sometimes a few
treatments with diathermy will produce movements in a
case of long standing paralysis. Babinski and Froment
counsel not only diathermy, but a general motor reëducation.
The idea of the diathermy is that the deeply penetrating
heat affects blood vessels and muscles, bringing about a vasodilatation
or even a direct addition of needed calories. In
like manner, galvanism, light baths, or simple baths in combination,
and with diathermy, especially with the diathermy,
act favorably. Casts and apparatus have also proved without
avail, as well as faradic or galvanic reëducation.</p>

<p>The above two cases show how in one instance there may
be no electrical change and in another instance a slight one.
In these cases, reflex hypertonic contracture, hypotonic paralysis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[608]</a></span>
vasomotor disorder, decalcification of the skeleton
(X-ray), mechanical overexcitability of muscles, unmodified
tendon reflexes (except elective exaggeration of reflex under
anesthesia, <i>e.g.</i>, a persistent unilateral patellar clonus when
all other reflexes have been abolished), and disorders of electrical
excitation are enumerated by Babinski and Froment.</p>

<p>Delherm sums up the electrical disorders as follows:
Muscle faradized:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(<i>a</i>) No change.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Subexcitability.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Overexcitability.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Diminished contractility to faradism, associated with
increased contractility by galvanism (Charpentier).</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Anticipated fusion of shocks (Babinski and Froment).</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) Slow contraction and decontraction on faradism
(Charpentier).</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) Rapid exhaustion of rhythmic faradic contraction
with metronome.</p>

</div>

<p>Muscle galvanized:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(<i>a</i>) No change.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Subexcitability.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Overexcitability.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Suddenness of galvanic contraction with subexcitability.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Re</i> decalcification and osteo-articular changes, Babinski
points out that the reflex or physiopathic phenomena run
historically back to John Hunter, Charcot, and Vulpian.
Charcot and Vulpian called especial attention to the peculiar
amyotrophy and paralysis which occurred in joint disease,
and upon the lack of parallelism betwixt the intensity of the
joint disease and the severity of the paralysis or atrophy.
The atrophy was without R. D.</p>

<p>Shell-shock: Functional blindness (monosymptomatic).</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 433.</b> (<span class="smcap">Crouzon</span>, January, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A shell burst above the head of a sergeant in a battle near
Neuf château, August 22, 1914. The man was kneeling at
the time; felt a terrible shock, slipped prone, lost consciousness
and woke in the evening blind. Next day he could
hardly distinguish light from dark. Yet the light reflexes
were normal; the fundus was normal.</p>

<p>This Crouzon calls the symptomatic triad for functional
nerve blindness of Dieulafoy. There have been similar cases
following eclipse of the sun and nervous shock. The eclipse
cases suggest that the bright flash might have something to
do with the sudden blindness (yet blindness has appeared in
cases in which the shell burst behind the patient).</p>

<p>The diagnosis of temporary blindness, with a prognosis of
early recovery, was made. The neurological examination
was normal.</p>

<p>For its suggestive effect, glycerophosphate injections and
progressive reëducative measures were adopted. The patient
was shown that he could see, first, the contour of objects,
then details and colors, then large letters and later small
letters. In a month the blindness was almost well. Five
months afterwards there was still a certain haze over the
field of vision and a slight difficulty in distinguishing certain
colors.</p>

<p>Jousset states that aside from visual alterations as the
result of cranial trauma, and aside from various transitory
amblyopias such as scintillating scotoma, the main varieties
of amblyopia are:</p>

<p><i>First</i>, Congenital amblyopia.</p>

<p><i>Second</i>, Amblyopia due to cerebral intoxication.</p>

<p><i>Third</i>, Retrobulbar neuritis and toxic amblyopia.</p>

<p><i>Fourth</i>, Amblyopia ex anopsia.</p>

<p><i>Fifth</i>, Hysterical amblyopia.</p>

<p>The most frequent amblyopias among the soldiers are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">[610]</a></span>
exanopsia. Aside from a few amblyopias caused by prolonged
occlusion of the eyelids, ptosis, or blepharospasm, the most
frequent are due to opacities, ametropia, and strabismus.
The hysterical amblyopias are, as a rule, associated with
blepharospasm due to intense photophobia, and are sometimes
associated with constant lacrimation. Vision at a
distance is poor. The patient succeeds in reading but shows
an asthenopia of fatigue. The cornea and the conjunctiva
are anesthetic, and sometimes the eyelids also,&mdash;the so-called
anesthesia <i>en lunettes</i>. The pupils are large but react
properly. The patient complains of many species of disorder;
loss of the sense of the third proportion, micropsia,
megalopsia, diplopia, erythropsia, diplopia in two colors, inverted
image, hemierythropsia, rotatory amblyopia. There
is concentrated limitation of visual fields, exaggerated by
fatigue and by intense light; reduced in dim light or when
the patient is provided with smoked glasses; enlarged upon
the instillation of atropin or with convex glasses. As a
rule, with unilateral amblyopia, the functional disorders start
in binocular vision. Practically the most important diagnostic
feature is the anesthesia, since this cannot be readily
simulated. Sometimes corneal anesthesia is found in non-hysterical
persons, who may perhaps be regarded as potential
hysterics.</p>

<p>Retrobulbar neuritis (nitrophenol).</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 434.</b> (<span class="smcap">Sollier and Jousset</span>, April, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A soldier of the 54th Artillery entered hospital 45, November
4, 1916. He had had a slight paralysis of the left brachial
plexus in 1913, following a shoulder dislocation, but the
only relic of this when the war began was a deltoid paresis.
He had been working from August 13, 1915, at the factory
in Saint-Fons, and was as yellow as the majority of the
workers there. He had never shown xanthopsia.</p>

<p>The first symptoms of his left brachial plexus neuritis had
begun six months before, after 9 months’ work in the factory,
and showed themselves in an increase of the deltoid paresis,
with pains in the hand and forearm, and cramps of the hand,
interfering with work, formication in the right hand and in
the feet, diminution of visual peculiarity (objects forgotten
and reading difficult). It was only in November that he got
perturbed about these difficulties, which had begun in May.
There was a paralysis of the levators and rotators of the left
shoulder, with a slight atrophy of the deltoid and of the
supra- and infraspinatus muscles. The arm could be extended
almost to the horizontal with difficulty. There was
one centimeter atrophy. The forearm and hand were not
atrophic but slightly weak. There was an anesthesia of the
shoulder-joint region, and of the outer surface of the arm;
a hypesthesia of the posterior surface of the forearm and
dorsal surface of the hand and fingers; tendon and periosteal
reflexes normal. Sometimes the hand would contract firmly
and could be opened only by the aid of the other hand. The
nerve trunks of the axilla, upper arm, and forearm, were
painful on pressure, especially on the left side, and the ulnar
nerve was thickened and rolled under the finger. The knee-jerk
and Achilles jerk were abolished on the right; plantar
reflex diminished; right posterior tibial nerve painful on pressure,
and its territory was hypesthetic. There were cramps
in the feet.</p>

<p>Gymnastics and electrotherapy and rest reduced these
phenomena. The eye grounds were normal; there was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">[612]</a></span>
paresis of accommodation, and an absolute blindness to
green, with retraction of fields to 15 degrees in the right eye,
and 20 on the left. There later developed a slight edematous
neuritis of the nerve, corresponding to the evolution of a
chronic retrobulbar neuritis of toxic origin.</p>

<p>It is the chronic retrobulbar neuritis which is typical of
the so-called nitrophenol neuritis, developing in soldiers employed
in making explosives. The above case is accordingly
exceptional in its association of a severe peripheral neuritis
with the optic neuritis. Typically, after six months to a
year in the factory, the cramps and formication of the legs
are felt, and the gradual diminution of vision with transient
blindness, finally leading to inability to read, sets in. The
green blindness, the accommodative paresis, and diminution
of central vision, the concentric contraction of the visual
fields, are the usual story. At first the eye grounds are
normal; there is then an edematous neuritis, and finally a
white atrophy. According to Sollier, the accommodative
paresis is like that in post-diphtheritic paralysis&mdash;a disease
due to cerebral cortex intoxication. In fact, the photomotor
reflex is normal, and what we have is an inversion of
the Argyll-Robertson sign. These symptoms are those of
retrobulbar neuritis, of nicotino-ethylic origin, and it may be
thought that the melinite was simply acting by creating a
soil for alcoholic intoxication, but none of the patients examined
has been alcoholic, nor has any been permitted to
smoke in the factory. The injurious agent is probably a
body in the nitrophenol series, perhaps dinitrochlorobenzol,
but whether this substance is absorbed through the skin,
inhaled, ingested from the hands, or by all three routes, is
doubtful. These workers are often cyanotic while at work
because the nitre products produce vasodilatation. Possibly
this dilatation of vessels has something to do with the neuritis.
The workmen will not use the spectacles and antitoxic
masks given them, and even do not use the rubber gloves
constantly. In some factories only, a liter of milk is given as
counterpoison, every day.</p>

<p>Slight wound of occiput: Ophthalmoplegia externa,
influencible, however, by tests and replaced by
spasmodic convergence of globes with myosis; hysterical
stigmata and convulsions.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 435.</b> (<span class="smcap">Westphal</span>, September, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A German volunteer, 20, was slightly wounded in the
occiput by revolver-shot at Ypres. Then followed headaches,
vertigo, and complaints of pains in the eyes such that
he could not open them or see sidewise. May 5, 1915, he
showed a picture of an ophthalmoplegia externa: complete
immobility of the two bulbi, lively blepharoclonus, rapidly
passing into blepharospasm, photophobia. The visual field
for white was practically limited to the fixation point. Central
scotoma for all colors. Otherwise normal.</p>

<p>On further examination, the apparently immobile bulbi
were found to pass into convergence upon request to look to
the right or left. <i>Thereafter</i>, this position of convergence
was assumed if any test made by a strong light, such as that
of a pocket flash, was used. The pupils contracted to the
maximum during this assumption of the convergent position
of the globes, and no further light reaction could be observed.
The convergence gradually passed off when the light was
removed. The appearance of bilateral external ophthalmoplegia
had disappeared.</p>

<p>If the patient was requested to follow a finger moved to
one side, the globe of that side to which the finger was being
moved, stood unmoved in its central position, but the other
globe followed the eye and placed itself in the convergent
position. The patient complained of diplopia. Even after
the closure of one eye a double vision appeared (monocular
diplopia). There was achromatopsia. The cornea failed to
react to stimulation.</p>

<p>There was an analgesia of the skin of the whole body, with
a hypesthesia for tactile stimuli on the left side. Smell and
taste absent. The convergent position of the globes with
myosis was preserved in the midst of convulsive seizures,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">[614]</a></span>
which could be produced by exciting the patient. When it
was attempted to dissolve the eye troubles by hypnosis, convulsive
attacks occurred. The patient was pronouncedly
hysterical.</p>

<p>The case is beyond question hysterical,&mdash;the phenomena
consisting of an ophthalmoplegia externa, alternating with
spasmodic contracture of the internal recti, associated with
myosis and loss of light reaction. The influencibility of this
situation during the process of tests, to say nothing of the
other stigmata, clinches the diagnosis&mdash;an important one,
since the development of an external ophthalmoplegia after
occipital trauma might possibly be regarded as an organic
disease due to hemorrhage in the region of the eye-muscle
nuclei.</p>

<h4><b>Case 436.</b> (<span class="smcap">Harwood</span>, September, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A four-pound wet sandbag fell eight feet on the head of a
sergeant-major, 28, lying in a Gallipoli dug-out, November
24, 1915. The sergeant-major was removed to Lemnos with
headache and giddiness, and a week later developed bilateral
internal strabismus with double vision and head noises.
The diagnosis was “brain tumor” or “syphilitic meningitis
of the base.” On the voyage home, the diagnosis was altered
to “multiple neuritis or neurasthenia.”</p>

<p>He was admitted to the King George Hospital, January 1,
1916, unable to move the eyes outwards; they moved rather
poorly up and down. There was a slight lateral nystagmus.
The patient had been unable to read or stand since the accident.
The visual acuity of each eye was less than 6/60, but
with an arrangement of lenses he could get 6/5 with either
eye. He had perfect binocular vision and could read ordinary
type comfortably. In a week’s time he was able to
stand without support and walk with a stick. Whenever he
took off the glasses, the strabismus and diplopia immediately
returned. Other combinations were tried but failed to relieve

<p>Hemianopsia: organic or functional?</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 437.</b> (<span class="smcap">Steiner</span>, October, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A 19-year old volunteer, never ill (no nervous disease in
the family), after a period of training went into the field,
October 3, 1914. November 5, a shell struck the trench
nearby but failed to explode. Up to that time everything
had been quiet. The soldier had been looking out of the
loophole, surveying the terrain. He felt a great fear, got a
blow in the neck, fell down unconscious, remained unconscious
for an unknown time, and later walked back with his
comrades. About an hour later, this volunteer,&mdash;who was a
very intelligent young man, possessing much knowledge of
biology, including the nature of visual fields,&mdash;noticed a
black spot in the field of vision, which came and went, but
after a few hours remained continually without disappearing.
Otherwise, there was no complaint except a feeling of
dizziness when stooping.</p>

<p>Upon examination there could be found no disorder of the
internal organs. Neurologically there was blinking, vasomotor
excitability, slight reddening of the face, and dermatographia.
An expert in ophthalmology confirmed the existence
of a homonymous defect in the fields of vision. This
defect could not be influenced by suggestion or by any other
treatment, nor did any other change whatever occur in the
condition.</p>

<p>Steiner inquires whether this hemianopsia is to be taken as
organic or functional. The air-pressure of the shell hissing
past might have produced a concussion, or the falling unconscious
might have produced a commotio cerebri or a slight
hemorrhage. The tic-like blinking and vasomotor excitability,
however, suggest functionality.</p>

<p>Hysterical pseudoptosis.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 438.</b> (<span class="smcap">Laignel-Lavastine</span> and <span class="smcap">Ballet</span>, January,
1916.)</h4>

<p>Laignel-Lavastine and Ballet present a case of what they
term hysterical pseudoptosis in a patient who showed no
signs of organic disease of the nervous system, and moreover
no special mental disorder. This soldier, 30 years of age,
working in the auxiliary service, suffered from a troublesome
lowering of his left upper eyelid. He went to the front
in February, 1915. Aside from suffering a few mild and
temporary blindnesses (<i>éblouissements</i>), he was entirely well
up to the time of being wounded, March 18, 1915, by a
bullet in the arm, and a bullet occasioning a superficial and
slight wound 2½ centimeters above the middle of the left
eyebrow. About three years later, a shell burst near him
and made a large contusion about the right eye, without
hurting the globus. He was then evacuated to Châlons-sur-Marne,
and there remained for 48 hours, totally blind, probably
on account of spasmodic closure of his eyelids. He
then began to be able to use the left eye, which remained,
however, very photophobic. A fortnight later, the wounds
were healed, but the patient found himself unable to open
his right eye. Three months later he returned to his dépôt,
and left for the front October 24.</p>

<p>He was reëvacuated November 4, as unsuitable for service.
He was then examined by an ophthalmologist at
Chartres, who found a very mobile right pupil and a slightly
atrophic right papilla; vision ½; left eye normal; vision ⅔;
total paralysis of right levator palpebrae superioris without
contracture of orbicularis. There was also paresis of the
left upper lid, which ceased when the right eye was closed.
The right half of the face was anesthetic, but there was no
corneal anesthesia.</p>

<p>November 15: Right eyebrow lower than left; if the head
was moved backward, the right eyelid followed the movements,
and in this position there was no ptosis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[618]</a></span></p>

<p>November 16: Analgesia in the super- and sub-orbicular
region. November 17: frontalis and orbicularis functions
normal.</p>

<p>At time of examination, patient complained of not being
able to open his right eye, and that he could only partly open
the left eye. To catch a view of his examiner, he had to
throw his head back and to the right. He could not open
his eyelids, and in the effort to do so, the forehead muscles
contracted; and whereas the left eyebrow was properly
elevated, the right eyebrow was only partially elevated.
Associated movements could be noted in the musculature of
the lower part of the face. In looking to the right, the eyelids,
especially the left, were elevated slightly. The patient
complained of photophobia. From time to time, he felt
completely blind, and at the end of these spells of blindness,
he had a severe headache. His head felt heavy. Sometimes
on looking to the left, he saw objects double, although
this diplopia had grown less marked of late. All the muscles
of both eyes appeared to work normally. Upon pressure on
the right globus, especially pressure directed from above and
behind on the internal part, the patient would raise his left
eyelid, but the paresis reappeared the moment the pressure
was released; a fact which the patient himself noted while a
tampon was being placed upon his eye.</p>

<p>It seems there had been a wound at the external angle of
the eye, some nine or ten years before, as a consequence of
which the eyelid of this side could never be parted as well as
before. The accident in question had happened in 1905,
and there had been a slight suppuration of a wound 2½ centimeters
from the external angle of the palpable fissure.</p>

<p>The patient then went through a period of reëducation.
It seemed that when he was trying to raise his eyelids, there
was a mental inhibition which could be overcome only by
effort. An attempt may be made to resolve the phenomena
into three groups:</p>

<p>First, enophthalmia of the right side (post-traumatic, antebellum,
a predisposing cause).</p>

<p>Secondly, a situation corresponding to so-called hysterical
pseudoptosis of Charcot and Parinaud (eyelid falling without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">[619]</a></span>
wrinkles, head thrown back, frontalis contraction on
effort to open eyes, eyelid lowered). The diagnosis of hysteria
was supported by the transient opening of both eyelids when
a sudden sharp order was given to move the eye-<i>balls</i>, and
further supported by synergic automatic lid-movements when
the patient voluntarily raised his eyes. He could not raise
his eyelids to order.</p>

<p>Thirdly, functional ocular palpable synergy (left eye opening
upon compressing the right eye).</p>

<p>Shell-shock Rombergism.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 439.</b> (<span class="smcap">Beck</span>, June, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A soldier, 24, had sundry signs of traumatic neurosis. A
curious and unexplained feature is the fact that in the course
of testing for Rombergism he would fall forward like a log if
his head were held in the vertical position, but if it were
turned to the right he fell to the right; if it were turned to
the left, he fell backward. Tests showed that he had no
disease of the vestibular apparatus and no sign either of
cerebral or of cerebellar disease.</p>

<p>The question is raised whether shell-shock can produce a
differential Rombergism such as hitherto would have been
explained on the basis of some organic vestibular disease.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> Rombergism, see especially Bourgeois and Sourdille’s
(edited by Dundas Grant) remarks on disturbances of balance
which, if of labyrinthine origin, obey Romberg’s law, namely,
are greatly increased with the eyes closed. Upon test, however,
normal equilibrium, tottering, or a tendency to fall will
be usually found. The tendency to fall is, as a rule, toward
the side of the affected labyrinth, yet it varies according to
the position of the head; that is to say, actually upon the
position of the labyrinth with relation to the body. If there
is a lesion of the right labyrinth, for example, and the head
is turned to the right, falling is to the right; but if the head
is turned 90 degrees toward the right, the patient tends to
fall backward because in fact the injured right labyrinth has
now become posterior in position. But if the head with the
injured right labyrinth is displaced 90 degrees to the left, the
tendency would be to fall forwards.</p>

<p>According to Beck, there was in his case of Shell-shock
Rombergism no ear disease or any evidence of cerebellar or
cerebral disease.</p>

<p>Walking with the eyes open yields in marked instances a
sidewise bending or even the classical staggering called the
duck’s walk and drunken gait upon a broad base. The
most delicate test, according to Bourgeois and Sourdille, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[621]</a></span>
the Babinski-Weil test of walking with the eyes shut. A
man with labyrinthine disease deviates from the straight
path (he is made to walk forwards and backwards ten times
in a clear space); bends pretty constantly to one side when
walking forward, and pretty constantly to the other side
when walking backwards. Spontaneous and Babinski’s induced
nystagmus (rotation; caloric) and Babinski’s voltaic
vertigo test are the other tests commonly employed in
equilibrium investigation.</p>

<p>Otology and neuropsychiatry should go hand in
hand.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 440.</b> (<span class="smcap">Roussy</span> and <span class="smcap">Boisseau</span>, May, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A soldier in the engineers, 29, entered the neuropsychiatric
center at Scey-sur-Saône, August 23, 1916. His diagnosis
was: organic shock syndrome with right-side deafness and
tremors. He carried a ticket showing an otological examination:
tympanum normal; Rombergism absent; walks with
eyes closed swerving to right; tends to fall, eyes closed, on
standing on one foot; vertigo produced by rotation in either
direction; no nystagmus either spontaneous or by test; deafness
especially on the right side; equilibrium function insufficient.</p>

<p>The patient had undergone shock in April, 1915, being
buried and then losing consciousness for twenty-four hours.
The tremors appeared next day, and also deafness but without
speech disorder. Nine comrades are said to have been
killed beside him. The hospital ticket, April 13, said: deafness
and multiple contusions from shell explosion. The
patient was evacuated to Clarmont-Ferrand and went back
to service with the same tremor and auditory disorder. He
was shortly sent back to the interior for six months and returned
improved to the front August, 1915. But he heard
the cannon in the distance, and, under the influence of
emotion and the fatigue of the journey, the tremors and
deafness reappeared.</p>

<p>The tremor was generalized, involving both arms and legs
and a slight lateral movement of negation of the head every
ten or twelve seconds. Occasionally tonic contracture of the
face, lips, cheeks, forehead; tremors of tongue; winking.
The tremors were somewhat suggestive of toxic tremors.</p>

<p>The deafness was evidently exaggerated. Voltaic vertigo
tested normal. Reflexes normal.</p>

<p>The diagnosis psychoneurosis was made and the patient
was rigorously isolated, given a long psychotherapeutic talk
concerning the nonreality of his deafness and his vertigo and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">[623]</a></span>
the possibility of cure by means of a very disagreeable electrical
treatment. He made improvement upon psycho-electrical
treatment and the next day both tremors and deafness
had greatly diminished. September 4, the patient was
considered completely well. There was a slight diminution
of hearing in the right ear, the whispered voice was heard at
50 centimeters on the right side, the watch at 25 centimeters
on the right and 60 on the left.</p>

<p>October 5 the patient was sent back to his corps. On the
evening of his departure, angry at not having received leave,
he boasted to his comrades of having passed but three days
at the front since his injury.</p>

<p>It is remarkable, according to Roussy and Boisseau that
this patient had passed sixteen months without ever having
been taken for a neuropath or treated as one. The otologists
gave the diagnosis of labyrinthine shock, but did not
attend to the tremors. The pseudo-symptoms disappeared
in six days at the neurological center and the cure had lasted
six weeks at the time of report.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> otology in these cases, see Bourgeois and Sourdille’s
book mentioned under <a href="#case439">Case No. 439</a>, particularly Chapter
III, upon the functional examination of hearing. In the
present instance, it will be noted that voltaic vertigo tested
out normal. According to Bourgeois and Sourdille, the
Babinski electrical test is the most convenient one to begin
with, to learn in a few moments whether the vestibular
system is working normally or not. These authors found
amongst twelve patients, three normal reactions and one
instance of hypo-excitability amongst four subjects who, by
other tests, failed to show vestibular disturbance. Inexcitability
as to voltaic vertigo was found in one man with a
destroyed labyrinth. There were four instances of hyperexcitability
in Babinski’s cases with marked equilibrium disorder.
A case of Ménière’s disease yielded the same results.
According to the intensity of the current, the following phenomena
(in addition to the pricking sensation) are noted;
(<i>a</i>) salty taste; (<i>b</i>) sidewise swaying with slight vertigo;
(<i>c</i>) nystagmus with more pronounced vertigo; (<i>d</i>) sensations
of sound. In short, nerve branches that go through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">[624]</a></span>
the petrous bone, namely, the chorda tympani, the vestibular
nerve, and the cochlear nerve, have been successively
stimulated. Babinski’s test was published before the Barany
work on induced nystagmus, but Barany’s rotation test for
the physiological excitation of the semi-circular canals, and
his caloric test for the investigation of the ears and canals
separately are to be utilized in addition to the Babinski
voltaic test. Babinski’s law of voltaic vertigo is that a normal
subject inclines to the side of the positive pole; a pathologic
subject falls to the side to which he tends to incline
spontaneously. If the labyrinth has been destroyed, there
has been no reaction.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> <a href="#case440">Case 440</a>, Roussy and Boisseau in their capacity as
neuropsychiatrists, point out the inadequacy of an otological
examination taken by itself. They insist that neuropsychiatrists
should be called in. It is probably equally true that
neuropsychiatric work upon deaf cases is often inadequate
on account of the lack of otological examinations. According
to Bourgeois and Sourdille, the expert otologist’s problems
are as follows: (<i>a</i>) Deafmutism; here Gault’s cochleopalpebral
reflex is of value. The hearing of a sudden noise
causes contraction of the orbicularis palpebrarum on the
side upon which the noise is suddenly and unexpectedly
made. Eyelash tips are particularly watched.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Complete bilateral deafness. This is practically never
organic; complete bilateral deafness is a phenomenon either
of traumatic hysteria or of simulation. Sundry methods of
surprising the patient into hearing have been adopted. The
practice of teaching lip-reading to simulators and hysterics
has led to some difficulties in diagnosis, but tests have been
produced by Gosset (of one sound with the lips set to form
another, and the like) which are of service.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Extreme bilateral dulness of hearing.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Total unilateral deafness. For the minutiae of tests
for these types of hearing disorder and their simulation and
exaggeration, see the War Manual of Bourgeois and Sourdille.</p>

</div>

<h4><b>Case 441.</b> (<span class="smcap">Jeanselme</span> and <span class="smcap">Huet</span>, July, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A Lieutenant of Infantry, 32, was struck by a bullet September
6, 1914, in the upper part of the left temporal fossa
4 cm. above the external auditory meatus. He did not lose
consciousness, but had the sensation as if his head had been
shot off, and about three minutes later he turned about,
fell down, and lost consciousness. However, he regained
consciousness a few minutes later and walked with support
for about an hour. At the ambulance, he lost consciousness
again, for half an hour. He was then carried to Amalie-les-Bains.
The trip lasted 108 hours. The left side of the face
was now swollen so that he could not open the eye nor
could he chew from swollen mucosa folded between the jaws.
The bullet was removed Sept. 12, from just below the scalp
outside the bone, the point being slightly bent back. The
bone had been depressed slightly for an area the size of a
franc piece, and pressure at this point yielded a feeling of
pain and discomfort. There was no suppuration. After a
week, the man got up. He returned to his dépôt October 3
or 4 and was about to rejoin his corps when he had a sensation
of pressure in the head and fell. When he came to himself
he found that there was a frothy saliva at the left side of the
mouth and that the whole left side of the body felt weak.
The tongue had not been bitten nor had urine been passed,
and twenty minutes later he felt as well as ever. He returned
to the front in the Argonne, having from time to
time similar crises,&mdash;at least once a week. Ordered to take
a trench the night of January 17, he failed the first time,
about midnight, but succeeded at four in the morning,&mdash;just
afterward falling exhausted in another crisis, with unconsciousness.
The stretcher bearers took him back and he was
evacuated to Perpignan. He had two convulsions.</p>

<p>While with his family the crises grew in number to three
or four a week, and sometimes twice a day. Upon request,
he was sent to hospital in the Pantheon May 5.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[626]</a></span></p>

<p>There was always a sensory aura, consisting in a violent
shock felt in the left side of the cranium like a blow of a club.
There immediately followed a crawling sensation in the fingers
and hand of the left side, running up the arm, with loss
of consciousness coming on before the crawling reached the
elbow. The seizure would last two or three minutes. There
was no initial cry. The face grew pale. There was apnea,
and frothy fluid running out of the left side of the mouth.
There was no jerking of face or limbs; at the end of the
seizure there were no deep inspirations. The extremities of
the left side were rather flaccid during the attack.</p>

<p>A hemianesthesia was found affecting both skin and
mucosae of the left side, and a slight retraction of the visual
field on the left side was found. There were no other sensory
disorders; the knee-jerks were lively on both sides but
not actually exaggerated. Plantar stimulation was not perceived
on the left side. The toes, except the great toe, were
slightly extended. The fascia lata reflex failed to demonstrate
itself. On the right side the great toe went into flexion
on forcibly stimulating the sole. Sometimes the abdominal
reflex on the left side was weak or even absent. The
patient, who had never been nervous, had now become so
since his attacks. He had had nocturia up to 12. There
was no evidence of neurosis or psychosis in the family.
Bromides diminished the crises a little in number. Static
electricity was given from January 8,&mdash;no attacks for 8 to
10 days.</p>

<p>According to Jeanselme and Huet, this is a case of Jacksonian
syndrome of an hysterical nature, about which it
may be noted that the bullet struck the left side of the skull
and the hemianesthesia and muscular resolution appeared on
the same side as the injury.</p>

<p>Leg tic: Phobia against crabs.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 442.</b> (<span class="smcap">Duprat</span>, October, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A man, shell-shocked in 1916 (with loss of consciousness,
disorientation and confusion followed by nightmares, memory
disorder, attention disorder, irritability, mental instability
and over-emotionalism) later still showed a choreiform
tic. He had a knife-grinding movement of the left leg which
made standing and walking difficult. There were no signs
in the reflexes or reactions of organic disease. The man himself
said that he felt a sensation like little electric shocks when
his foot touched the ground, a sensation like pinching. He
also had certain hysteriform crises. He was able to remember
nightmares in which he felt as if he had fallen into a hole
where there were crabs. In point of fact, he had a true
phobia against crabs, crayfish, lobsters and the like; if he
saw one, he always felt as if he were going to have a new
crisis. The defense movement of the leg and foot was
against a supposed pinch of the crab. At rest, there was no
trace of the choreiform movement. The tic was especially
marked when the man was suddenly asked to get up and
walk. In a few days, when he had become more clearly

<p>Convulsions reminiscent of fright.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 443.</b> (<span class="smcap">Duprat</span>, October, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A soldier, 28, was blown up February 8, 1915, by a shell
burst. He sustained no contusions but became completely
mute. On July 3, he began to speak in a low voice. The
<i>torpillage</i> treatment was unsuccessful because the man felt
a morbid apprehension that the vibration of a loud voice or
even of a rapid walk would resound in his brain. He had a
sort of noise phobia, probably maintained by nightmares
which frequently woke him up with a jerk though he could
not remember their content. On the way back to his dépôt
this man got off the train at the first station and went to a
hospital complaining that the vibration of the train was going
to be transmitted to his brain. Hysteriform crises developed
in a few days.</p>

<p>According to Duprat these crises are nothing but a psychomotor
development of the initial complex. The clonic and
tonic convulsions are reminders of his states of extreme
fright, a phenomenon of revival of the ideo-affective process,
aggravated however by the oniric or post-oniric images.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> diagnosis of hysterical fits, the absence of facial cyanosis,
sub-conjunctival hemorrhages, petechiae of skin, and
the Babinski reflex are suggestive for hysteria. Babinski
points out that the initial cry, the fall, the loss of consciousness,
the tongue-biting, the bloody frothing at the mouth,
the urinary incontinence, and the post-convulsive prostration
can all be consciously or unconsciously imitated. Hysterical
convulsive movements are apt to be of wide range,
gesticulatory, and opisthotonic.</p>

<p>Babinski announces to the supposed hysteric that he is
going to reproduce the attack, as he is perfectly able to do
by electricity. A mild current or mere electrode application
suggests a fit in a hysteric, often very quickly. Babinski
now announces that he can arrest the fit; carries out
some selected procedure, and stops the fit. During the
hysterical fit, the patient of course hears what is being said
and during this time wrong suggestions must not be offered.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="case444">
<p>Fugue in a motor cyclist, with prodromal fatigue and
subsequent delusions&mdash;recovery in six weeks.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 444.</b> (<span class="smcap">Mallet</span>, July, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A motor-cyclist, 36, with the colors from the outbreak of
the war, about April, 1916, grew very weary, suffering from
headache and seizures without loss of consciousness. Finally
there was a voice: “Sleep, you must sleep.” Then other
voices; then ideas of thought transference with people
around him.</p>

<p>Observed in the psychiatric center, May 12, 1916, he had
the same ideas of thought transference, and he made as if to
talk with the attendants by responsive-looking gestures.
Sometimes, he said, fluid struck his forehead, calling on his
thought. Whereupon he listened. The man made no complaints
about his plight, was not astonished in any wise at
what was happening, nor did he seek to explain it. There
was nothing in his history to suggest psychopathy except
perhaps that his father was unknown.</p>

<p>The diagnosis of a chronic hallucinatory psychosis was
made, but the outcome promptly overset the diagnosis. The
man talked with ward-mates, and particularly with another
patient who also talked about thought transference. This
shook the man in his convictions, and he decided that it was
but imagination and delirium.</p>

<p>He now told his story: How it seemed that he had in his
thoughts the phrase, “Sleep, you must sleep;” how he had
gotten up, saying, “No;” had noticed the others paying no
attention to him; had gone back to his work and from that
moment had begun to go into delirium. During this delirium
or delusional state, his whole life from birth up, came
back to him, as if some one were telling him. The headaches,
which he at first felt due to Hertzian waves, suddenly
ceased.</p>

<p>Shortly, however, a new phase had set in, in which he felt
himself surrounded by spies and that others had control of
his thoughts and were reading them. In fact, he grew a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">[630]</a></span>
little proud of the fact that people reading newspapers all
around him were actually reading his own thoughts. The
letters he wrote were being dictated. May 9, he spent a
night with a succession of nightmares, and woke up with the
firm purpose of going back to Paris by motor cycle to find
the spies. He described his fugue and the thousand ideas he
had on the way, his arrest, his imprisonment in a cell of
Hertzian waves with a smell of sulphur and poisoned bread&mdash;a
necessary fate on account of the spies.</p>

<p>On arrival at hospital, he had not known what was going
forward. The nurses were giving him milk to destroy the
taste of sulphur; the delirium then grew less and less. The
room-mates were neutrals, war-weary; he seemed to be reading
the newspapers before his mates, and they seemed to be
talking of thought transference. May 20, the ward was
changed. The new ward-mates did not believe in thought
transference and laughed, causing the man to doubt.</p>

<p>June 2, the cure was in full process, and the ward was
changed again; but in the new ward was a patient who had
the same ideas of thought transference as the patient. At
this time, the man’s autocritique saw through the delusion.
He talked with his telepathic comrade and pretended to engage
in a fake conversation about it. The delusions shortly
disappeared, having lasted about six weeks.</p>

<p>Ordinary gunner’s life; a few days’ feeling of moral
and physical discomfort: Obsession leading to
fugue.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 445.</b> (<span class="smcap">Mallet</span>, July, 1917.)</h4>

<p>An artilleryman, 32, gave himself up a few kilometers
back of the lines, three days after deserting his post. The
man was a very good gunner and had never been punished
once. Moreover, the battery was not under any special
bombardment, and he had been in the same place a number
of weeks.</p>

<p>He explained that he had gotten tired during the last few
days. Everything was well at home and in the regiment,
but he felt sad, his head felt bad, and he couldn’t sleep.
Something drew him to leave, but then “<i>sang froid</i> came
back to me, and I gave myself up.” He had lived the three
days without eating and without sleeping. He was very
emotional over what he had done, but he began to work and
asked that he be sent back.</p>

<p>His mother had been very nervous. There was a marked
facial asymmetry and faulty arrangement of teeth. The
man was not alcoholic.</p>

<p>According to Mallet, in these cases of fugue, and in other
cases of absolute delirium of apparently sudden onset, there
is a feeling of moral and physical discomfort for some days
before the outbreak. The outbreak itself is sudden on the
occasion of some idea, either an obsession or a hallucination.
Of all the prodromal signs, headache is the most striking.
According to Mallet, such fugues are the expression of a
mental imbalance allied to the onirism of Régis.</p>

<p>Aprosexia and bird-like movements.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 446.</b> (<span class="smcap">Chavigny</span>, October, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A soldier of the dragoons, 25, entered Chavigny’s service
May 30, 1915. He acted like a mechanical figure, requiring
guidance. The face was without expression except for the
mobile eyes, and sudden bird-like movements of the head,
continually attracted to new noises and objects. An interlocutor
was glanced at but not responded to. If an intense
electrical shock was passed through his abdomen, for example,
the man would look for a moment in that direction,
but only the most fugitive defence reaction would be made,
and the stimulus could be repeated with the same result, a
moment later.</p>

<p>After three days, this aprosexia began to clear, and in four
or five days, answers to questions and ordinary associations
set in. Memory reappeared. It seems that he had been in
concealment in the loft of a barn, when he saw his commanding
officer carried by, having lost an arm and a leg.
He lost consciousness and fell three meters, through the trapdoor
of the loft. There was thus a combination of trauma
and emotional shock. No external lesion was produced in
the fall. His memory showed a very sharply defined gap for
the period of his aprosexia with the bird-like movements, of
eight days, and his memory was perfectly good up to the
time of the fall. This is one of five cases observed by Chavigny,
who remarks that there is something in the attitude
of the young child which recalls the aprosexia of these patients.
(Perhaps the phrase of James, “buzzing, blooming
confusion” might be used.) One must go back to a period
in the child’s development when he is not yet able to smile
or keep his glance fixed on a shining object. On the whole,
the resemblance is closer to the attitude of certain caged birds.</p>

<p>Shell-shock; unconsciousness (45 days): Mutism
(monosymptomatic).</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 447.</b> (<span class="smcap">Liébault</span>, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A soldier, 32, had a large caliber shell burst one meter from
him September 26, 1915, lost consciousness and remained
comatose 45 days. He then got progressively better but
did not recover speech. He was neither blind nor deaf. He
was examined at the neurological center at Nantes and there
Mirallié called him a case of hysterical mutism, finding no
paralytic disorder of any sort and finding the patient able
to write his story, to read and to understand what he read,
but without much power of retention. He was placed in the
phonetic reëducation service March 30, but made no progress.
In the effort to speak the patient made strong generalized
contractions, including contractions of his face and
winking of his eyes, contractions of the jaw, and movements
of the neck muscles. In fact, he seemed to be agitated by a
sort of cervico-facial tic, and sometimes, although not always,
he succeeded in getting out a loud voice sound, in
which one could imagine the syllable that he was trying to
utter.</p>

<p>In this case the mutism was evidently secondary to motor
disorder. It is an example of functional dyskinesia (Benon).
As long as this functional dyskinesia remains, the patient will
not speak. The respiratory muscles are disordered, since
the respiratory capacity does not go over 3 liters. This
approaches the normal, however, and if the subject cannot
speak it is because his diaphragm is subject to jerky or
cramplike movements and because the lips and tongue do
not execute the proper movements either for sounds, syllables
or words. Such a patient cannot protrude the tongue
or even bring it beyond the teeth.</p>

<h4><b>Case 448.</b> (<span class="smcap">Mairet and Piéron</span>, April, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A shock case of Mairet and Piéron had a disorder of memory.
Association paths were open one day and closed the
next. Subjected to shell-shock, September 18, 1915, he was
found wandering in the woods a few days later, having completely
lost his memory, even for his name. In November he
recovered his surname but not his given name. On stimulation
he was gotten to remember his city, his father, the
street, and the like. Shortly he could get back his memories
more quickly; after a week it took only 35 seconds to
remember that he was born at Paris. However, his recollection
of the Trocadero and of the Eiffel Tower, which had
come back to him in November, 1915, was lost again in
April, 1916, to return once more in August. December, 1915,
he could not write to dictation, but copied writing as he would
a design. He suddenly felt himself able to write in the
Morse code (he was a telegrapher); then ordinary writing
returned. February, 1916, however, he had forgotten what
the Morse code was. In April, he was taught numbers.
One day he would know left from right, but had forgotten it
by evening.</p>

<p>Shell-explosion: Comrade killed: Amnesia.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 449.</b> (<span class="smcap">Gaupp</span>, April, 1915.)</h4>

<p>F. K., a 23-year old soldier, in civil life a turner, of Polish
descent, and of a somewhat nervous and easily excitable disposition,
early in August went from Strassburg into the
Vosges and Lorraine. On the 26th a number of shells exploded
near him. The troop was excited and took refuge in a cellar.
K.’s best friend was torn to pieces by a shell. When his
body was removed, K. felt sick and lost consciousness. He
arrived at the clinic in Tübingen in a stuporous condition,
by hospital train, on August 31, 1914. He walked weakly to
his bed, supported by two men, and lay in the bed, apathetic
and reacting to questions only with a stare. Things put in
his mouth were swallowed. He remained motionless.</p>

<p>Next evening he answered a low <i>Yes</i> to a nurse’s question
about eating. A little afterwards he said he supposed he
was a prisoner in the enemy’s country. A little later he got
properly oriented but still did not know how he had come.
September 2, however, he was much clearer and said he had
awakened out of a long dream. There was a complete
amnesia, however, from the moment when he went to help
remove the torn body of his friend up to September 1.
Memories became clearer for the period before the shell explosion.
The patient became very lively, talking vividly of
war experiences, imitating shell hissing with an expression
of intense anxiety, getting accustomed to battle scenes, saying
that he was now seeing everything again as if real. He
remained anxious for some days, complaining of weight on
his chest and of feelings of internal restlessness and tension.</p>

<p>Amnesia for the period of August 26 to September 1 remained;
all that K. could add to the story of those days
was that he had been thrown sidewise for some distance by
the air pressure of the shell.</p>

<p>From September 6 onwards, he grew calmer but he was
still very labile, given to lively imaginings and emotion. By
the middle of September he was well and discharged for
garrison duty.</p>

</div>

<h4><b>Case 450.</b> (<span class="smcap">Mairet and Piéron</span>, July, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A man, 33, had suffered shell-shock early in December,
1914. His intervening history is not reported, but he
showed on admission to the service of Mairet and Piéron,
May 5, 1915, a remarkable amnesia. There was a complete
cutaneous anesthesia, anosmia, and ageusia, and he was mute.
He lived only in the specious present. His previous life was
completely abolished for him. He could dress himself, eat,
use a fork and spoon, and a glass. He understood ordinary
words; such words as man, woman, day and night, however
had no meaning. He was observed for 15 months and presented
four phases.</p>

<p>In phase one, there was a measure of success in reëducation,
such that he grew able to recognize a few persons, to
find his bed, and name objects. He was got to copy writing,
to learn the alphabet, and to say a few words. He could not
write from dictation, however. Less than two seconds after
looking at an <i>A</i>, he had forgotten how it looked and could
not trace it. This first phase lasted about two months.</p>

<p>The second phase began with fatigue, headaches, and the
rather quick effacement of all he had relearned. If an
errand was given him to do, he would run to do it before he
should forget it; but if the trip required more than 4 or 5
seconds, he had to stop, not knowing what to do with the
thing in his hands. He was still able to recognize 4 or 5
persons, but could add no more to his repertoire; and when
one of them had been absent for a fortnight, he did not
recognize him on his return. He could not remember the
time for his meals.</p>

<p>The third phase was ushered in by improvement after
vomiting; his speech came back in a feeble voice, November
16, 11 months after the shock. Reëducation could now
be undertaken again. He easily relearned a number of
things, feeling the greatest astonishment at his new acquirements
as to the sun and the moon, the trees and the flowers,
and the like. He expressed a curiosity to see his own home,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">[637]</a></span>
but when he went thither, he could recognize nothing. He
wanted to get back home, namely to the hospital where he
had lived all his life; where, in fact, he had been born from
the psychic point of view.</p>

<p>At this time began the fourth phase, April, 1916&mdash;a
phase of decline once more, in which a large portion of his
acquisitions were again lost and he fell back to his condition
in the second phase.</p>

<p>See discussion under <a href="#case353">Case 353</a> and under <a href="#case367">Case 367</a>. <i>Re</i>
confusional mental states, Roussy and Lhermitte, after distinguishing
stuporous confusion from simple confusion, go
on to differentiate what they call obtusion (see also discussion
under <a href="#case353">Case 353</a>). These authors say that Régis,
in common with most psychiatrists, fails to distinguish the
slow thinking and amnesia of true mental confusion from the
temporal and the spatial disorientation that characterize the
so-called obtusion. Of course, in all attacks of confusion,
both attention and memory are affected, but there are special
types in which attention defects and memory defects
stand out in relief. The first of these types is the aprosexic
type with birdlike movements, described by Chavigny (see
for an example, <a href="#case446">Case 446</a>). This aprosexia may be combined
with mutism, deafness, or convulsions. The form of confusional
disease in which amnesia is the out-standing feature
is due to toxic or infectious disease, or is a Korsakow phenomenon,
<i>i.e.</i>, in the psychiatry of peace times; but the
war has brought out amnestic confusion in other states
than the toxic, infectious, and alcoholic states (Régis,
Chavigny, Dumas, Roussy and Lhermitte). The amnesia
may be incomplete, a sort of dysmnesia, or twilight memory,
but as a rule, the amnesia is lacunar. The toxic and infectious
amnestic confusions have a loss of memory for events
following the onset, but these war cases of amnestic confusion
have the loss of memory running back far into the
patient’s past, slipping from the mind his name, his parentage,
age, and vocation. Instead of being like the toxic confusional
amnesia, an anterograde amnesia of fixation, the
Shell-shock amnesia is apt to be antero-retrograde. These
antero-retrograde amnesias, whether due to emotion or to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">[638]</a></span>
strong physical shock, may sometimes leave in sharp relief
the recollection of the shock or event itself which initiated
the amnesia. Meanwhile the patient does not forget automatic
actions of dressing, reading, writing, and the like.
The amnesia may be very selective, imitating aphasia, word
blindness, letter blindness, agraphia, and the like. All this
is part of the hallucinatory form of mental confusion which
Régis describes as oniric delirium (see for oniric delirium,
discussion under <a href="#case333">Case 333</a>).</p>

<p>Lépine distinguishes amongst the confusions, five forms as
follows: Simple confusion, hallucinatory confusion, acute
delirium, stuporous confusion (under which Lépine also considers
the battle hypnosis of Milian, see <a href="#case365">Case 365</a>, and
Roussy’s narcolepsy), and amnestic confusion. All these
phenomena from the clinical point of view are connected
with an acute and fleeting insufficiency of the most delicate
or, as it were, psychic portions of the cerebral cortex, the
delirium, so to speak, being activity of the unconscious,
whereas a confusion is due to a clouding of the centre O of
Grasset’s polygon.</p>

<h4><b>Case 451.</b> (<span class="smcap">MacCurdy</span>, July, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A territorial, 19, who had enlisted in January 1914, reached
France in September, 1916. He was of neurotic make-up
(night terrors, fear of dark, giddiness in high places, fear of
tunnels, enuresis until 10 years, worry about seminal emissions),
and had always had a tendency to short wind. Enlisting
at 16, he found it hard carrying his pack at first but
soon grew stronger. The trench life was distasteful. He
began to wish that he might be killed, or at all events removed
from the trenches. Pains developed under the heart,
with shortness of breath, palpitation, dizziness, and faint
feelings. The man connected these heart symptoms with
what he called his weakness of gall bladder (namely, enuresis).
He was several times sent off duty for heart treatment.
After three months in and out of hospital, he got trench foot,
was sent to England, and transferred to a special heart hospital.
Here the pulse test was positive, in that the rate did
not diminish as it normally does after two minutes’ rest.
After graduated exercises for several months, the pulse test
had become negative and the heart had gradually improved
from the organic standpoint. The patient, however, insisted
that his heart trouble was as bad as ever, and was
probably consciously hoping that his symptoms might persist.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> soldier’s heart, Abrahams classifies cases that come to
the military surgeon for heart symptoms as (<i>a</i>) functional
fatigue cases; (<i>b</i>) nicotine and drug cases; (<i>c</i>) organic heart
disease and Graves’ disease; (<i>d</i>) the true soldier’s heart,
occurring in men with a neurasthenic soil that lose control
of the vasomotors and inhibitors of the heart.</p>

<p>An Australian gunner, 35, of a neurotic make-up (night
terrors; horror of blood; fear of thunderstorms, high places,
tunnels, horses; shy with both sexes), benefited by military
training physically, but remained as neurotic as ever. On
the way to his first service in Egypt, he feared shipwreck,
and in Egypt was troubled by the weather and occasional
palpitations and sinking feelings. He was transferred to
the French front, May, 1916. He was terrified and depressed
under shell fire, and horrified by blood. Peculiar
sinking sensations or feelings that the soul was leaving the
body came to him as he was going off to sleep; from which
he woke at times with sudden starts. Later he had nightmares
of things, mainly shells, falling on him. He worried,
wanted death, and thought of suicide. In May, 1917, he
was blown off his feet by a shell. Thereafter he began to
feel that shells were being especially aimed at him, and four
days later got a pain in the side, and began to tremble and
breathe with difficulty, as if his throat were swelled up and
he were going to choke. He ascribed this to gas. The
bombardier finally sent him back to a hospital, where he
grew weaker and screamed aloud on being awakened by his
dreams. After six weeks in a special heart hospital, all the
symptoms cleared up except the choking feelings and fear of
instant death. Organically the man appeared normal. An
initial pulse of 96 ran up to 168 after exercise, and down to
84 after two minutes’ rest.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> soldier’s heart, Abrahams speaks of sundry hypotheses
that he regards as erroneous. Soldier’s heart has been
thought to be (<i>a</i>) athlete’s heart; others regard it as (<i>b</i>) a
toxemic condition, possibly of bacterial origin; (<i>c</i>) hyperthyroidism
(a larval form of Graves’ disease has been incriminated);
(<i>d</i>) excessive cigarette smoking; and (<i>e</i>) deficiency
of buffer salts in the blood, have been proposed by
other authors.</p>

<p>Gallavardin has especially studied the tachycardial cases
revealed by the war, cases in which auscultation is frequently
unable to detect aught. These tachycardiacs are often
hypertensive. Sedentary service should be found for them.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> pulse 168 after exercise, Gallavardin found 8 per cent
of 500 non-organic and non-tuberculous cases to run up
from 150 to 175 (125 to 150 in 27 per cent; 100 to 125 in
37 per cent; 75 to 100 in 26 per cent; 50 to 75 in 2 per cent).</p>

<p><i>Re</i> cardiac neuroses, Brasch points out that cardiac neuroses
in the male in war time have found a strange new association
with hyperesthesia of the skin. The patients showed
dermatographia and hyperreflexia. The hyperesthetic zones
of Head and Mackenzie were found by Brasch in all cases of
organic cardiac disease, but also in two cases of cardiac
neurosis in hysterics.</p>

<p>Moore calls attention to somewhat similar phenomena in
the somatic group of nervous and depressed cases found in
the war. These patients are fatigued, exhausted, sleepless,
tremulous, vascular, and cardiac cases, with dermatographia,
areas of paresthesia, and pains in the neighborhood of wound
scars.</p>

where he had reported sick for dysentery. The field ambulance
where he was treated was near the shell fire, and a
shell knocked him into a ditch. The ambulance had to move
to a cave. Thereafter the patient suffered from tremor when
spoken to or when watched. After discharge, he was employed
as a dispatch rider on a motor cycle, but after three
months lost his nerve for this work and took charge of fatigue
parties. He found the work too much for him. He had been
a total abstainer. Finally the malingering charge was
brought up.</p>

<p>The patient was nervous, delicate-looking, with widely
dilated pupils, prominent eyeballs, tremor of right arm, and
pulse of 102. The tremor was markedly lessened when he was
alone, and was somewhat under control. He felt that his
memory was defective, and tests demonstrated the defect.</p>

<p>In hospital patient slept better, the pupils grew smaller, the
pulse rate diminished. There was a reduction in sensibility
to pain over the right side of the head and body and over
the right limbs. A prick of the right arm or leg was described
as a finger touch. There was also almost complete hemi-anosmia
and complete hemi-ageusia on the right side. Visual
acuity was diminished on the right, and there was general
limitation of right field; left-sided vision and field normal.</p>

<p>After a month in hospital at home and two months’ leave,
the patient was discharged no longer physically fit for service.
He is now weak physically and mentally, subject to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643">[643]</a></span>
severe headaches, and tremulous, especially in the right arm,
when tired.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> malingering, Sicard denies the existence of unconscious
malingerers (presumably regarding this phrase as a figure
of speech in relation to hysteria), and divides malingering
into a creative and an acquired form. The <i>simulateur de
création</i> assumes attitudes and symptoms to attract attention
or pity; the <i>simulateurs de fixation</i> having been sick
in the beginning, perpetuate their disease, in brief, crystallize
their neuroses. The <i>fixateur</i> may be very realistic in
all this, seeing that he has known from his own experience
what a real disease is. The formula runs: The <i>simulateur
de création</i> improvises; the <i>simulateur de fixation</i> repeats.</p>

<p>According to Mott, malingering in the form of an assumed
Shell-shock is not uncommon amongst soldiers, and is rather
hard to distinguish from a neurosis developing on the basis
of an <i>idée fixe</i>.</p>

<p>Ballet’s definition of simulation is “a subjective or objective
disorder which the patient invents with the idea of
voluntarily and consciously misleading the observer.”
Closely related to simulation is exaggeration or prolongation,
conscious or intentional, of a real disorder. Babinski
states that cases of genuine simulation are very rare, and
that the subject under suspicion should be given the benefit
of the doubt. Especially the word <i>simulation</i>, or similar
words, should not be uttered in the presence of the patient.
Practically speaking, psychotherapy applied as in cases of
hysteria may often cure the simulator and the exaggerator.</p>

to be impossible, and after exerting considerable force,
Dr. Dunhill was able to rupture a massive fibrous band of adhesions
that had prevented extension. The officer made a

<h4><b>Case 455.</b> (<span class="smcap">Voss</span>, November, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A volunteer, 18, just before the war had a fall in which
apparently he injured his skull. In December, 1914, he hurt
his left forearm. About this injury he sometimes said he
fell in a storming attack in a trench and broke his arm, and
again he said his arm had been smashed by stones from a
falling house. From that time forward there was paralysis
of the left forearm with flexor contracture. May, 1915,
slight hypesthesia could be demonstrated on the ulnar side
of the arm, suggesting ulnaris injury. There were, however,
no considerable electrical changes.</p>

<p>Six months later the man was sent up with a suspicion of
simulation. In the meantime the contracture had resolved
and there was a typical hysterical paralysis with all signs of
neurosis. Six months later he was well enough to be examined
for military service.</p>

<p>Here was a case in which the incorrect data offered by the
patient himself as to the origin of his paralysis gave rise to
the suspicion of simulation, whereas, as a matter of fact, the
man was clearly hysterical.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> incorrect data supplied by the patient to his own disadvantage,
Lumsden remarks on the great difficulty of diagnosis

<p>Forearm wound: Hysterical edema?</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 456.</b> (<span class="smcap">Lebar</span>, July, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A corporal, 26, formerly a farmer, was struck in the
forearm by a shell fragment on the mid-portion of the radial
border. The wound was slight (the fragment entering and
emerging hardly 2 cm. apart) but bled profusely, according
to the patient, who was evacuated next day but one to a
hospital in the interior. By this time the right hand was
swollen, nor could any movement of hand or fingers be made.
Massage, mechanotherapy, passive movements did no good.</p>

<p>The man entered the neurological center of the Eighth
Region, July 7, 1915, when there were already a few skin
changes with dorsal thinning and palmar thickening. There
was cutaneous anesthesia not only of hand and fingers but of
the forearm to the elbow, and this anesthesia included heat
and cold. Position sense was preserved. There was no
evidence of atrophy except for the skin changes. An electrical
examination showed normal conditions.</p>

<p>July 13, a sealed bandage was put on, but at the end of
five days the hand looked as before. July 19, a new treatment
was announced to the patient. With a hot needle a
number of pricks were made on the dorsal surface of the
hand and a few c.c. of fluid were withdrawn (containing a
slight amount of albumin and a few lymphocytes), whereupon
a dry bandage was put on. The next day a few finger and
thumb flexion movements could be made and sensation had
returned. Sensation completely returned July 21. The
flexion movements were still incomplete, by reason of the
edema and dryness of the skin. However, July 22, flexion
was better and the swelling had gone down sixty per cent.
Jacquet’s biokinetic treatment (active gymnastics of the
hand and fingers) was given for four hours. July 25, the
edema had greatly diminished and normal motion had returned.</p>

<p>Examination excluded renal disease. There was no sign
indicating phlegmon. Quincke’s disease had other features.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">[647]</a></span>
Fraudulent application of a bandage might be considered,
but the course of the disease under sealed conditions seems
to exclude this hypothesis also. May it, therefore, not be a
case of hysterical edema?</p>

<p><i>Re</i> hysterical edema, see remarks under <a href="#case407">Case 407</a>. In
the case above, of Lebar, Babinski calls attention to the
fact that the edema and the contracture diminished though
they did not entirely disappear after the scarifications. This
physical treatment did not act, according to Babinski, wholly
as a matter of suggestion, and he fears that some cases of
so-called hysterical edema are really cases of physiopathic
vasomotor disorder; in fact, three of the cases published
(and amongst them, the present case of Lebar), were cases
of edema associated with contracture and developing in an
injured limb. To prove a case of anything to be hysterical
is, of course, according to the Babinski school, to submit it
to a therapeutic test and cure it by suggestion.</p>

<h4><b>Case 457.</b> (<span class="smcap">Voss</span>, November, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A man, injured by shell fragments in the head and sustaining
fracture of both arms and a thigh, got well of his
wounds, but fell into a nervous state with headache and
dizziness. He was given prolonged observation psychiatrically
and then sent back to the front as fit for service, but
was shortly returned to hospital and sent to Cologne under
the suspicion of simulation.</p>

<p>The picture was of unilateral increase of tendon reflexes,
accelerated pulse, disorder in the intake of ideas, difficulty in
finding words and delayed associations. His gait suggested
a psychogenic disorder. X-ray showed two shell fragments
in the vault of the skull.</p>

<p>According to Voss, it is a sad fact that victims of skull
injuries are frequently charged with simulation or exaggeration.
In the above instance, moreover, this charge was
undoubtedly inaccurate.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> simulation, see remarks under <a href="#case453">Case 453</a>. <i>Re</i> neurological
cases, the Neurological Society of Paris sent to the
War Ministry a special note pointing out how tardy was
the reference of sundry neurological cases to the special
neurological service. They pointed out how important it
was to send to these special services all cases of bullet and
shrapnel lesions.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> the malingering question, there is a wide divergence of
opinion, even amongst experienced workers in the same city.
The late Professor Dejerine said he had not seen a single
case of malingering. In fact, he thought that malingering
amongst soldiers and amongst injured industrial workers had
been much exaggerated. Marie, however, working in the
examination of many surgical cases, found malingering relatively
common. Amongst forty of his cases, he regarded
at least nine as malingerers or exaggerators.</p>

<p>“Sciatica,” torticollis, stiff arm: The desire to
avoid active service plus functional disease.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 458.</b> (<span class="smcap">Collie</span>, January, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A man enlisted September, 1914, went to France after six
months’ training, immediately put himself on sick list, and
was admitted to a base hospital: Diagnosis, sciatica. Later,
he ceased complaining of sciatica and developed spastic torticollis.
He was sent back to England, was treated with
radiant heat and so on, and was eventually sent to the Royal
Bath Hospital at Harrowgate.</p>

<p>He recovered from torticollis after six weeks’ treatment;
but then developed a spasmodic contracture of the right
shoulder and forearm. He was massaged for this and also
given high frequency treatment. Then came two transfers
(massage).</p>

<p>Early in December, 1915, he came under Collie’s observation.
He then showed right wrist bent at right angles to
the forearm; hand tightly clenched, so firmly that it seemed
as if the wrist were ankylosed. The case was obviously a
functional one. The man refused to enter hospital at Collie’s
suggestion. He was sent to the Maida Vale Hospital. Previously
he tried to persuade the medical officer that further
hospital treatment was unnecessary, stating that he was
now able to straighten his arm and that he was applying a
splint to keep it straight. He progressed slowly in the institution.
Told, if he would recover within fourteen days, he
would be classified “for home service only”&mdash;before the
fourteen days were up, he had suspended his weight on a
trapeze and pulled himself up to his chin on it; had also
lifted a 28-lb. weight with his paralyzed hand. In short, he
wholly recovered. He is now doing duty with his unit.</p>

<p>Collie says this is not deliberate malingering but a mixture
of functional disease and an obvious desire to avoid
active service. When he appeared before the board for a
final decision, there was a tendency to assume the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">[650]</a></span>
paralyzed position until he was sharply called to order, when
his arm assumed normal position.</p>

<p><i>Conclusion</i>: The direct personal treatment of his mental
condition and an appeal to his lower instincts were immediately
curative and of much more value than the radiant
heat or high frequency treatment.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> Collie’s case, Russel finds surprisingly large numbers of
malingerers; he found many at the time of the battles at
Loos. It was particularly easy in cases of epilepsy to demonstrate
a close relation between hysteria and malingering.
In the psychogenesis of these conditions, Russel emphasizes
the initial element of deception, which soon enormously increases
either through the patient’s convictions of his ability
to deceive or through a process of autosuggestion. Cases of
semi-malingering are not uncommon. In England, Russel
found more cases of a clearly psychogenic nature; yet in
these, also, there was always primarily an element of deception.</p>

rigidity and no reflex disorder. Asked to say “no” when he
could not feel a pin-prick and “yes” when he did feel it, he
replied “no” to each prick to the anesthetic area and changed
his reply to “yes” when the sensitive parts of the body were
examined. At another time the answers were found not to
correspond with those given before.</p>

<p>A man may seek to exaggerate an anomaly of his eye which
had existed before the war, in order to live comfortably far
from the front.</p>

<p>A soldier sustained a slight scratch from a shrapnel bullet
in front of the left ear, which scarred over in a few days.
The soldier said, however, that the bullet had gone through
his skull and a few hours after his wound said he could not
see. Sent to the hospital he continued to say he was blind
and finally brought up in an asylum for the blind near Lyons
where he was taught to cane chairs and to write in Braille.
This happened in July, 1915.</p>

<p>In October he was sent to the Hospital at Quinze-Vingt
where a diagnosis of hysterical amaurosis was made with a
large interrogation point. He was then sent to Brequet
where there was a section reserved for disciplinary cases and
very nervous cases not wanting to get well, a service under
the charge of Roubinowitch.</p>

<p>The soldier escaped with a comrade and eventually reached
Val-de-Grâce where the diagnosis of hysterical amaurosis
was again made. Examinations several times showed that
there was nothing abnormal about the eyes except that the
eyelids presented habitual fibrillary movements (antebellum).</p>

<p>The eyelids passively opened, would remain open for a few
minutes and then close. There was no winking of the eye to
a light, yet the pupil preserved its reflex power.</p>

<p>Vision was abolished, however, the soldier said. He was
without any other motor or sensory disorder. Much sympathy
was given to the poor blind soldier. People were
much astonished when the chief of the ophthalmological service
had the man isolated in a dark room. Three weeks
later the man had begun to see the light a little. A week later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_653" id="Page_653">[653]</a></span>
the eyes remained open without the necessity of having the
lids raised by the fingers, and vision returned.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> amaurosis, Parsons explains the blindness which may
remain after consciousness returns following Shell-shock, as
a condition in which the lower visual paths are carrying on
their functions normally. For example, the pupillary reactions
are preserved. The condition is not unlike that found
in amaurosis of uremia, and Parsons has found it in children
with posterior basic meningitis. For Parsons, therefore, the
block occurs in the higher centers above the thalamus, possibly
in the synapses of the optic radiation fibers. Ormond states
that the true cases of concussion blindness invariably pass
through phases of great discomfort; whereas the malingerers
are without such discomfort. Medical suggestion, also,
has a powerful effect here, and may actually retard recovery.</p>

<p>Sicard read in a French newspaper a story to the effect
that, at two o’clock in the afternoon, a soldier had fallen
on the sidewalk between Nos. 40 and 42 Boulevard de Liberté,
in a nervous crisis. The people ran and picked him up.
When he came to, he was very joyful, perceiving that the
shock had given him back his speech, which he had lost the
August previous. This soldier, the newspaper continued,
became deafmute through the explosion of a bomb in a fight
in Upper Alsace. “The brave soldier is most happy over
the unexpected result.” The newspaper went on, “We congratulate
him sincerely, as well as the people who assisted
him.” He was the more contented that he had gotten well
because, the soldier said, he would now be able to go back
among his comrades to fight with the Boches!</p>

<p>Now, in point of fact, Sicard had dealt with this soldier
the morning of the day in question. He had been simulating
mutism for ten months, and finally told Sicard that
he would like to leave that afternoon as he felt cure coming.
Sometime after, he wrote a letter of profuse thanks for the
benefits received, and said he did not deserve to avoid court-martial.
He also said that he was going to do everything
he could to justify himself. Incidentally, he kept his word

<p>A pure malingerer, of set purpose, initiates a quasipathological
condition which he will discard when he has gained his
end or when he is assured that he is unobserved. Malingering
in the field of speech is rare. A private, 26, one year in
service, three months in France, entered a base hospital,
deafmute for nine weeks. He wrote: “I should be very
happy if you can do anything for me. I cannot give a very
clear account of what happened, as it is sometime since.
I remember retiring from Hill &mdash;&mdash; with some more to some
trenches, and in the open we were shelled and I lost touch
with our chaps or else they were killed. I remember a great
concussion and finding myself on the ground, and a soldier
dragged me up and we ran for the trench. I was very thirsty
and I ran down the trench to get some water. I met one of
our chaps and tried to ask him for some, and I could not
make him understand. He only smiled at me. The man who
picked me up took me to an officer who was sitting on the edge
of the trench and tried to make me understand, and then
he sent me with this man to a dressing station, and from there
I have been to different places, the names of which I do not
know, except the last place, No. &mdash; Convalescent Camp.
I have been there about two months&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He seemed anxious to get well. He could not understand
what was said. Induced anesthesia caused no phase of
excitement, and the patient failed to regain his speech.
He was evacuated to England. Three months later the
patient thence wrote the following confidential letter from a
Convalescent Home.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_656" id="Page_656">[656]</a></span> “Sir,&mdash;I regret very much to inform
you that I was imposing upon you.&mdash;&mdash;I may state that I

but I kept going as I was determined to see what it was like
at the Front.&mdash;&mdash;I have written this&mdash;&mdash;that your ‘notes’
on cases will not suffer any detrimental effect through my
imposture.&mdash;&mdash;I have not got my discharge yet, but shall
stick out for it. I ‘speak’ but do not ‘hear’ very well.&mdash;”
He was in two hospitals for functional nervous disorders in
England, but in neither institution was he regarded as a
malingerer.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> hysteria explained by the patient as malingering,
Chavigny discusses what he calls <i>sursimulation</i>. The physician
must not fall into a permanent state of suspicion,
and especially must not reveal his suspicions to the accused
or to the bystanders. Chavigny quotes a French soldier
whose letter to his wife was intercepted, stating that he was
going to feign deafmutism to secure his discharge. Before
he had succeeded in doing so, however, he suffered Shell-shock,
and got a true hysterical deafmutism, which showed
no signs of malingering whatever.</p>

<h4><b>Case 464.</b> (<span class="smcap">Myers</span>, September, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A stretcher bearer was seen by Lt.-Col. Myers two days
after admission to a base hospital. Stolid looking and mute,
he had nevertheless talked in his sleep, had written a few
words about “shells coming over,” and understood what was
said to him. Lt.-Col. Myers’ notes run, “He puts out his
tongue and closes his eyes and holds out one hand when I
ask him to do so, but gets stupid (as if sulky) when I ask for
the other hand. He <i>will</i> not hear any more. Next day
quite deaf, and the following day light anesthesia with ether
caused a return of hearing and of speech, with repetition of
syllables to request on the way to deeper anesthesia. On
awaking he cried as he was induced to resume his speech, and
complained of pains in the head.</p>

<p>“Two days later, he seemed normal and said that he could
have spoken on the second day, but that his eyes and ears had
begun to swim, that he had felt dizzy, and was afraid to talk.
He did not want to be sent back to the trenches. There had
been severe shelling. He had lost consciousness until he
awoke in a hospital at Y&mdash;. He recalled, little by little,
how he had been taken back by a corporal to a cellar. He
said he wanted to go back, but wanted a rest first. He went
back to his unit and was reported as having done well for
four months.”</p>

<p>There was a certain suggestion of malingering about the
admission of the lad that he could have spoken before he
was induced to do so. According to Lt.-Col. Myers, a number
of patients upon recovery of speech are apt falsely to
believe that they have been malingering. Functional disorders
may simulate malingering.</p>

<p>Lannois and Chavanne warn against the suggestions given
to malingerers and to hysterics by the statements on the
tickets of admission borne by the patients for transfer,
<i>e.g.</i> “incurable deafness.” These authors found 11 per cent
malingerers amongst 262 cases of labyrinthine shock.</p>

He was unable to read or write. It was reported that he had
been wounded, but no evidence of wound could be found.
The man had a low forehead and a furtive glance, his whole
impression being that of a criminal.</p>

<p>The only evidence of disease found was inflammation with
perforation of the tympanic membrane of the left ear. Deep
in the left auditory meatus was found <i>a grain of crushed oats</i>!
The man’s speech difficulty was of a stuttering nature, but
he stuttered in a different way at every test. He was unwilling
to be narcotized. Finally by a process of scolding and
cajoling, the man was made to confess that he could both
hear and speak well. The peculiar stuttering early led to
the diagnosis of simulation, but the fact that the tympanic
membrane was not anesthetic, and that there was no anesthetic
zone in the body strengthened the suspicion&mdash;to say
nothing of the refusal of narcosis and the general behavior of
the somewhat criminal-looking soldier.</p>

<p>A lame rascal.</p>

<h4><b>Case 466.</b> (<span class="smcap">Gilles</span>, April, 1917.)</h4>

<p>An infantryman, 28, had an equinovarus, for which he was
evacuated, hospitalized, given treatment, sent home for
convalescence, and declared unfit for service. He was,
however, sent back to the front, and on arrival, went lame;
whereupon the regimental surgeon sent him to a nerve center.
The equinovarus was there but it was nothing but a simple
contracture without pain, atrophy, sensory, reflex, electrical,
or X-ray disorders.</p>

<p>The abductor muscles were stimulated by electricity and
the foot straightened. He was kept under observation for
a time, was lame no longer, and was sent back to his regiment.</p>

<p>However, sometime later he was evacuated again to the
same neurological center, stating that he did not know why.
There was no longer any varus or anything abnormal. The
rascal had enjoyed the game of going lame and had prevailed
upon his officers to evacuate him. He then saw that
he was found out and pretended that he had been forcibly
evacuated.</p>

<p>Mother love and jaundice.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 467.</b> (<span class="smcap">Briand</span> and <span class="smcap">Haury</span>, January, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A soldier, 19½, entered the central psychiatric service at
Val-de-Grâce, having been evacuated from a hospital in
Paris, <i>suspect</i> of having brought about a picric acid jaundice.
He had been undergoing treatment in this hospital, when
the physician who had isolated him found that he was getting
picric acid in packages secreted in his képi.</p>

<p>It seems that the soldier lived with his mother, and enlisted
when he was not yet 18. He proved to be as good a
soldier as he was workman, and came through the campaign
without wound or disease. Accordingly, in December, 1915,
he got a six-day leave. His mother, who loved him well,
and of whom he was the sole support, had much regretted his
enlisting. She was sick with some stomach disease and, after
he enlisted, she told everybody that she was going to die and
that it was his fault. So, when he came on leave the next
day, she asked him to take a powder so he might stay a fortnight.
She did not tell him the name of the drug; only told
him how to take it in a small paper, swallowing it with a
little water. She said he would become yellow and that he
would get a supplementary leave. Three days after his
return to the front, the boy took three of the ten powders;
took the same number three or four days later; and the others
five or six days later. He soon had jaundice with colic and
diarrhea, and apparently was exempted from service for a
few days. He had returned to the front hardly a month
when his mother died and the boy got another six-day leave
for the funeral. He took ten fresh doses of picric acid while
at Paris, and was put into hospital by a physician without
suspicion. His relatives thought he was suffering from a
recurrent jaundice. When the story was told, the boy confessed
to the family, and said that he had taken the drug in
the first place only to please his mother. It is harder to
explain the second trial, since he talked about the compassion
and sense of obedience he felt to his dead mother. It is
probable that he simply wanted a prolonged leave at Paris.</p>

<p>Swelling of hand and forearm, seven months.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 468.</b> (<span class="smcap">Léri</span> and <span class="smcap">Roger</span>, September, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A soldier was wounded September 22, 1914, at Charleroi
by a bullet in the forearm. He came under observation
May 14, 1915, with a huge edema of forearm and hand,
suddenly stopping at the elbow, an elastic edema, especially
marked in the palm, which was restored to its smooth contour
very quickly after being compressed by the fingers, and very
like an elephantiasis. The hand was in a position of moderate
extension on the forearm, with fist clenched. There was a
linear ecchymotic line at the upper edge of the zone of edema,
especially on the antero-internal face.</p>

<p>According to the soldier’s own story, the swelling had begun
a fortnight after the injury. He said that a very tight
moist dressing had been applied during the first few days.</p>

<p>The patient was cared for by massage, and then by local
baths. He was anesthetized in December and several drains
were inserted; no result. In January he was chloroformed
again and two long incisions were made along the internal
border of the supinator longus and along the ulnar border of
the forearm. He was better for two weeks after this second
operation, but then grew worse.</p>

<p>The diagnosis of syringomyelia was now made, based upon
the appearance of the arm and upon some ill-defined hypesthesia.
This diagnosis was not entertained by Léri and
Roger who, when they obtained the patient, put him into a
plaster cast up to the shoulder. The edema went down
rapidly to normal. In short, it was here a question of a
simulator, who was even willing to undergo surgical operations
with general anesthesia.</p>

<p>Gaupp’s simulator had not been under shell fire. He said
to his captain that he wanted to see his badly wounded
brother (he had in fact no brother), and got a furlough on
this ground. He then fled as far as possible from the front,
into the interior, roved about for some days, falsely asserting
that he was under dentist’s treatment.</p>

<p>He was brought to Tübingen on the ground of mental
derangement, on a hospital train, and was delivered to the
clinic as a case of Shell-shock. This man’s state of excitement
soon ended. As Gaupp could not make out his case
clinically, he applied to the regiment and received in return
court-martial papers. The man confessed that he had made
false statements and fled because he was afraid of shells.
Reproached with simulation, he preserved a shameful silence.</p>

<p>SIMULATION: Question of Quincke’s disease.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 471.</b> (<span class="smcap">Lewitus</span>, May, 1915.)</h4>

<p>An infantryman was brought to the eye department of
the Wieden Hospital early in May, 1915, with a diagnosis
(from the internists) of Quincke’s disease.</p>

<p>Under the conjunctiva of each globus oculi were countless
small air vesicles. There was not the slightest emphysema
of the eyelids or of the skin about the eyes. The
skin in the neighborhood of the zygoma was thick, red and
swollen; but no air could be demonstrated in the subcutaneous
tissues on palpation. Next day the skin swelling and
the conjunctival emphysema had disappeared. No communication
of the orbits with the air spaces of the skull
could be demonstrated nor was it possible to push air into
the conjunctiva by nose-blowing. The fundi were both
normal and vision was normal. Special rhinological examination
showed the nose to be normal. It was the skin swelling
of the orbital region that had given rise to the diagnosis of
Quincke’s disease. The man had been then referred to the
internists who could, however, find no evidence of disease
whatever.</p>

<p>During the three months’ stay of the patient in the eye
department, once more swelling of the left orbital region
and air under the conjunctiva of the left globus oculi suddenly
appeared one day, but disappeared over night. At this time
small subconjunctival ecchymoses were found.</p>

<p>This case must be regarded as one of simulation but produced
in a manner unknown.</p>

<p>Bruises of head and back, not severe: “A case
of pensionitis, a self-made neurasthenic for medicolegal
purposes.”</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 472.</b> (<span class="smcap">Collie</span>, May, 1915.)</h4>

<p>Sir John Collie remarks that sometimes one has to recommend
a pension knowing that what amounts to a fraud is
being perpetrated. A seaman, 25, got newspaper notoriety
after receiving some not very serious bruises of head and
back. Two months later, when seen by Sir John Collie,
he was a victim of bent back. He was finally able to remove
his clothes and put them on with some alacrity, although at
first he declared he could not. Woebegone during examination,
he was noted to laugh and gossip with strangers outside.
A physician had diagnosticated it as an obscure spinal
lesion, but as he was fit to work, he was sent back.</p>

<p>Forty-one days later he put himself on the sick-list again.
Pluck and nerve were gone beyond recall, according to his
physician. In hospital his appetite was good, he slept well,
and he had no troubles except an hysterical loss of sensation.
There followed 33 days in hospital, three weeks in a convalescent
home, and return to work for a month. Unable to
stoop or kneel for pain, he was thought organic.</p>

<p>Sir John found him without desire to get well, hysterical,
and suffering “from pensionitis, a self-made neurasthenic for
medico-legal purposes.” He was placed for four months in a
nerve hospital. On leaving this hospital he was still in the
bent-back position, and went into a pantomime display when
asked to touch his toes. Four weeks in the convalescent
home found the following: The attending physician now
suggested locomotor ataxia as the correct diagnosis! Sir
John Collie was asked to report finally as to the fitness for
work. Well assured that the patient was really a malingerer,
Sir John nevertheless certified him as permanently unfit for
further service as a case of traumatic neurasthenia, venturing
to predict that after receiving the pension, he would be at
work within six months. He received the pension (25 s. a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_667" id="Page_667">[667]</a></span>
week for life), and Sir John Collie’s ability at prediction was
justified by his return to work, at the end of exactly six months.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> malingerers, Glueck remarks that a malingerer, besides
being a malingerer, is a worthless sort of person in any
event, and calls attention to the fact that special stresses
may reduce men to lower cultural levels, to which lying and
deceit may be more appropriate. Glueck remarks that the
lay mind does not readily appreciate that a man with mental
disease may at the same time be a malingerer of additional
mental symptoms. It may be added that the professional
mind is sometimes equally slow to appreciate the fact.</p>

<p>In previous sections we have already become acquainted
with many therapeutic successes and failures: indeed it was
almost necessary to detail treatment in certain cases to show
the nature of the disease in hand or the correctness of a given
diagnosis. In the present Section we approach the question
more systematically.</p>

<p>After presenting a few examples of various spontaneous and
non-medical recoveries, we bring into contrast the types of
medical recovery that may be termed rapid (or miracle)
cures and those that fall under the general head of reëducation.
Admixed are cases of failure as well as of success:
if it be remarked that the case method puts forward the
best foot, it is probable that the same is true of almost any
therapeutics as reported in early articles. As we go to press,
trench reports indicate that at least one part of the profession
is far more hopeful of successful psychotherapy even in
the physiopathic group of disorders than their expounder,
Babinski, could concede. The true statistical evaluation of
the results must come years later.</p>

<p>Some neuropsychiatrists have been fond of saying that
there is nothing new in Shell-shock, that specialists have long
been familiar with the psychoneuroses, etc. Yet in the
past, specialists have not learned overmuch about the true
inwardness of the psychoneuroses. Even a casual inspection
of the various therapeutic efforts here described shows how
much novelty of observation and ingenuity of plan must
eternally be shown in these ever-so-simple psychoneuroses!</p>

<p>Shell-shock: Deafmutism. Spontaneous cure.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 473.</b> (<span class="smcap">Mott</span>, January, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A British soldier, 25, a coal miner, had had a bicycle
accident five years before, after which he was unconscious for
2½ hours, and gave up work for five weeks, with headaches,
fainting-fits, and nervousness ever after and with a tendency
to imagine he could see things when there was nothing
to be seen.</p>

<p>September 19, 1915, he was under shell fire in trench and
dugout. A sergeant and three men working with him were
killed by an explosion, and he remembers his cap being lifted
off his head. He came to in 46 Rest Camp, some time later,
unable to see clearly, or to hear or speak, and with headache
and insomnia. He brought a paper from a hospital in
France, saying, “Doctor, I had an awful dream last night
again; I was dreaming that I was in the trenches; I could see
the men falling and the great big shells exploding. I could
see the light from the bursting of the shells very plain. They
fairly lighted all the place up. I woke up very anxious I can
tell you. I wish I could give over dreaming, and I keep
having pains in my head right across my eyes.”</p>

<p>October 15, while sitting by himself outdoors, he felt a
slight crackling in his head, noticed that he could hear sounds
faintly, and in a few minutes he could hear fairly well.</p>

<p>October 17, he was heard making inarticulate noises in his
sleep. The corporal next him told him about the noises in
his half drowsy state; he tried to speak and said, “Mother.”
He then felt queer all over, with pain in his head, and afterward
became able to talk very well with slight hesitation.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> spontaneous cures, Elliot Smith and Pear cite the
cure of two mutes on hearing that Roumania had entered
the war, and the cure of another by seeing Charlie Chaplin’s
antics. Some workers (for example, Aimé), treat the functional
mutes by simply leaving them to themselves, and
maintain that they secure numerous spontaneous recoveries,
regarding these as superior to cures by isolation, psychotherapeutic
treatment, and the like.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> mutism spontaneously or non-medically cured, see also
cases 476, 480, 481, 482. For various medical methods of
treatment, see, <i>e.g.</i>, cases 516, 518, 520, 526, 544, 579.</p>

<p>Mott had a case which had been mute more than six
months, unable to whistle, phonate in coughing, or blow
out a candle, though heard to shout in his sleep: This
patient recovered his speech when pitched out of a punt on
New Year’s Eve. The condition was in one sense physical
enough, as the X-ray showed that the man’s diaphragm
hardly moved even with the greatest effort. Mott regarded
the inhibition of the breathing movements, especially the
phonation, as caused by fear. Mott speaks of a case that
recovered on being told by a comrade that he had talked in
his sleep. The man was so astonished by this statement
that he said, “I don’t believe it.” Other instances of cure
under quasi natural conditions are related by Mott: In the
presence of a functional mute, Mott speaks loudly to the
patient’s sister so that the patient may hear: “This man
must be kept on a No. 1 diet, and when he can ask loud
enough for you to hear, he can have a bottle of stout and a
mutton-chop.” Several mutes are reported to have gotten
well the next day under this treatment.</p>

<p>These effects shade imperceptibly over into the manifestly
suggestive, and probably no sharp line can be drawn
between the effects of medical suggestion, non-medical heterosuggestion,
and even autosuggestion. Adrian and Yealland
rather decry the Micawber line of waiting for something to
turn up. Zeehandelaar, a Dutch professor, studied Berlin
methods (Lewandowsky), and found numerous cases (both
of mutism and of deafness, paralyses, contractures, and
tremors) lying about without special treatment. According
to this observer, the expectant treatment was sometimes
successful, and sometimes not; if unsuccessful, the soldier
was sent home, and re-examined a year later; whereupon
he might be found to have profited by this long waiting and
to have gotten well enough to return to army duty.</p>

<p>A decorated officer, evacuated for Shell-shock on

</div>

<h4><b>Case 474.</b> (<span class="smcap">Gilles</span>, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A young officer, with many decorations for brilliant Colonial
service, was in the battle of the Marne, under six consecutive
days’ shell fire, smoked phlegmatically a cigarette
no matter whether walls were crashing or horses disemboweled
beside him, and was uniformly able to stimulate his
men to the heavy work by humor or heroic phrases.</p>

<p>A week later, on the third day of the Aisne, he had to be
evacuated. He was another man&mdash;wild-eyed, shivering,
jumping at the least noise, unable to eat or sleep, given to
battle dreams. He had to be carried away from the battle
zone and put in a bed in a town in the rear and given chloral.
The nightmares continued. On being awakened he would
ask where he was. He was kept in bed, given strychnine
cacodylate, and dieted. He went back to the front in four
days. Two days later he had to be evacuated a second time.
After some weeks more in the rear, however, he went back to
the front, and thereafter had not relapsed (April, 1916.)</p>

<p><i>Re</i> relapses, Wiltshire thinks their causes and frequency
prove the psychogenic nature of Shell-shock. Ballard states
that a severe case lasting six months does not recover in the
army. Many that are said to recover in hospital break down
at dépôts, often with symptoms quite unlike those which they
originally presented, and it will be remembered that Ballard
has an epileptic theory of the nature of Shell-shock. See
Cases 82, 83, and 84 in <a href="#A_PSYCHOSES_INCIDENTAL_IN_THE_WAR">Section A</a>, III, Epileptoses. But
another portion of Ballard’s contentions relates to a causation
through fear suppressions released by perturbing events.
According to Ballard, if the man endeavors to re-suppress
the released fear, the fits occur. Ballet and DeFursac note
the frequency of relapses&mdash;fewer after treatment at the
front.</p>

<h4><b>Case 475.</b> (<span class="smcap">Purser</span>, October, 1917.)</h4>

<p>An Englishman, 21, in a rifle regiment, arrived in May,
1915, at the Dublin University V. A. D. Hospital, being
dumb, impaired as to vision and hearing, having dilated
pupils, tremors, restlessness and weakness, and giving the
impression of visual hallucinations. Although suspicious,
he was treated kindly for a few days, recovered his hearing,
and wrote the few things that he remembered about home
and the war, now and then tremulously and perspiringly
writing down, “Asylum; do not lock up; I am not mad.”</p>

<p>With the idea of hypnosis, his bed was surrounded by
screens, whereupon he grew so perturbed that the attempted
hypnosis could not be executed. He learned the letters
PP, TT, SSS, A-OOO, and finally AA-SS, AA-TT, T-OO,
and after many weeks SS-SST-R and B-TT-R. His father
visited him and probably was recognized.</p>

<p>At the end of September another dumb Shell-shock case
recovered speech upon being given ether. Maj. Purser asked
the sister to arrange for a like treatment for the first case,
explaining that an examination of his throat might be painful.
The cure of the second case by anesthesia got into the
papers and before he was treated the account was possibly
seen by the hitherto gentle rifleman. At any rate, he was
seized with a sort of spasm, became furious and could only
see Germans coming and carrying off his machine gun. He
shouted for help. A half grain of morphine was given him
and when it began to take effect the fighting spirit gave way
to despair. He trembled over the loss of the gun, and remained
in this state of despair for three days, remembering
his regiment number and the like, but amnestic for his life
during the past few months. He could not read now because
print was indistinct. Words, when he had spelled
them out, conveyed no meaning. He had a functional alexia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_677" id="Page_677">[677]</a></span>
When he saw a picture of a bunch of flowers in a notebook of
his, he had another spell of excitement and regained his power
of speech, remembering about his experiences only that he
had been locked up. He had now completely forgotten his
father, who came to call.</p>

<p>By the end of October he was stronger, but his horizon was
still limited to the hospital surroundings and a little newspaper
reading. Headaches and impaired vision persisted.
Sight temporarily left him early in November, and there was
a suggestion of an epileptic fit one day early in that month.
Tonic and sedative drugs and suggestive remedies were of
no avail. Hypnotism made him worse, and psychanalysis
was, perforce, ineffective through the amnesia. At the end
of November depression and suicidal thoughts set in, with
an elevation of blood pressure to 178 m.m., pulse 80 to 90.
Maj. Dawson then thought he was a suicidal melancholic.
Rest in bed and thyroid extract were given, but the latter
threw up his pulse on the fifth day to 140. He grew better
mentally on the treatment, however, and his blood pressure
fell to 140 in three weeks. He was now over-emotional,
unable to stand or walk or feed himself or to pull on his socks.</p>

<p>For change of scene he was transferred to Mercer’s Hospital
in February, 1916. He suffered from astasia-abasia.
The tremor became jerky, coarse and persistent. The thyroid
gland grew a good deal in size during the spring and the
pulse went up to 120 per minute. There was also well-marked
dermographia and there was a suggestion of the clinical
picture of Graves’ disease. Even a quarter grain of morphine
had little or no effect upon an ineradicable insomnia.</p>

<p>Maj. Purser gave the case up as a bad job and the man was
discharged and sent home September 2, 1916. During the
next two months at home he improved in steadiness, though
he flushed if dealing with strangers, and improved as to memory.
He began to be able to read better. He had begun to
be able to get about on his feet without so much support.
The ultimate outcome could not be reported by Maj. Purser.</p>

</div>

<h4><b>Case 476.</b> (<span class="smcap">Jones</span>, 1915.)</h4>

<p>An Australian soldier of 20 went to Egypt, thence to Gallipoli
where, on July 29, 1915, he was almost completely buried
by earth from the bursting of a high explosive shell. He
was admitted to hospital August 5 and transferred to Malta,
where he did not speak, stared into space and sometimes
made, impulsively, attempts to get away. About September
17 he began to assist the orderlies and played draughts.</p>

<p>The diagnosis there was cerebral concussion. He was sent
back to Australia by transport and had to be put in a padded
cell on November 1, having become violent, noisy and destructive.
He would assault anyone who beat him at the game of
draughts and threw anything he could lay his hands on out
of the porthole. Hyoscine he resented and threatened the
givers by signs. He was at times restrained. He threatened
to throw himself overboard. Diagnosis: Melancholia.</p>

<p>At Melbourne he was found in good physical shape, but
dazed, mute, apparently deaf, indicating his wants by signs.
With pencil and paper he would draw a ship or a gun and
would copy any question put to him in writing. He played
draughts intelligently and made friends with one of his shipmates.
In four days’ time he began to communicate in writing,
answering simple questions correctly. Asked to put a
question, he wrote “Do you think I am mad?” On the appropriate
answer he shook hands with the physician heartily.</p>

<p>He was then sent to a military convalescent home at
Highton. Here he communicated often in writing, and had
an appreciation of sounds without distinguishing words.
At a picnic on December 4 he killed a snake. While returning
in the dark he began to whistle a song the rest of the
party were singing. At the end of the song he clapped his
hands and said, “What is the next item on the program?”
Thereafter he was able to hear and speak. Seen four days
later he asked to join the officers’ training school. However,
he was discharged as permanently unfit for the service.</p>

<p>Course in hospital of an oniric delirium.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 477.</b> (<span class="smcap">Buscaino</span> and <span class="smcap">Coppola</span>, January, 1916.)</h4>

<p>An Italian gun-maker, 27 (father neurotic; grandmother
and mother, alcoholic; patient excessive onanist), was called
to arms June 14, 1915, and went into artillery service in the
Tolmino, early in September. Some time later, a shell burst
about 30 meters away and killed his lieutenant. The patient,
however, was not hurt and did not even fall. He became
mute and inaccessible, and was sent to a military
hospital, and thence to an asylum in Udine, where he was
restless and hallucinatory. October 2, he was sent to Florence
on two months’ leave for convalescence. He was still
hallucinated, always seeing his dead lieutenant. He spoke
rarely, slept little, and his conduct became more and more
queer. Now and again, he would act exactly as if he were at
the front. November 5, he started off to find his brother,
but was met by a hospital attendant, who promptly took
him to a clinic. Here he was inaccessible and lived in a
hallucinatory way a soldier’s life at the front: in continual
movement, shielding his eyes with his hands as if looking far
into the distance, bending down to turn an imaginary lever,
apparently taking part of his aim, crouching in a corner,
clapping his ears with his palms, and obeying hallucinatory
commands: “Ready,” “Fire,” and the like. As to his interpretation
of the actual surroundings, he would give a
military salute at the entrance of the physician, as if he were
the lieutenant. Another patient near by was interpreted as
a spy. Hypodermic injections, November 6, were interpreted
as military antityphoid injections. On succeeding
days he piled dry horse-chestnut leaves for a parapet, which
became the scene of battle. November 12 he had become a
little more lucid. November 14, he evidently heard whistling
and made the leaves ready as a bed for horses. November
15, he rolled up his blanket in a military fashion and hid
in a cell corner. He explained, November 16, that he was a
sentinel and had not been relieved by the corporal. He had
saved everybody’s lives by signaling from a tree the presence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_680" id="Page_680">[680]</a></span>
of four airplanes. He could not be convinced he was in an
institution for the insane. November 20, he was virtually
recovered but amnestic for what he had done since commitment.
Headaches and dizziness. November 21, he remembered
some of his dreams, especially one of being blinded
and another of being tied by a German to a tree. By November
29 he had become lucid and oriented, but there was
an amnestic gap for his stay at the clinic. Early in December
the fields of vision were contracted; polyopia and a glaring
and burning sensation before the eyes (after each test conjunctival
and tear duct inflammation).</p>

<p>December 21, discharged well.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> the nature of oniric delirium, see discussion under
Cases <a href="#case333">333</a> and <a href="#case450">450</a>, Chavigny had but two cases out of 260
in which a <i>rapid</i> curability was noted (90 per cent finally
curable). Chavigny’s treatment consists of rest in bed,
quiet, purgation if necessary, and warm or cold shower
baths. Chavigny remarks upon the extraordinary transformation
from apathy to lucidity in the course of a few
minutes, brought about by arranging a slight but definite
emotional shock to the patient, namely, by mentioning in his
presence something about home or family. One bit of technic
was to get the patient to write or dictate a letter home.</p>

<p>Régis remarks that battle dreams of this nature occasionally
affect alcoholics in garrison or at home. The victim
ought not to be hastily committed to an asylum, but should
be treated in a military neuropsychiatric service with isolation
chambers and open wards. Régis organized early in
the war at Bordeaux a central psychiatric service along these
modern lines. He remarks that the central service ought
to receive not only patients from the military hospitals, but
also patients from the temporary auxiliary hospitals of the
city and district round about. A pooling of the military
and civilian issue upon rational lines is here indicated.</p>

<p>Régis and others have remarked upon the necessity of
differentiating these battle deliria from toxic and infectious
psychoses.</p>

<h4><b>Case 478.</b> (<span class="smcap">Buscaino</span> and <span class="smcap">Coppola</span>, January, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A fusileer, 20 (mother neurotic, brother hemiparetic from
infantile disease; patient had extreme otorrhea from an early
otitis media), entered the army January 15, 1915. He was
sent to the Isonzo in May and was slightly injured in the
nape of the neck and the left calf by fragments of a shell
that exploded near by. He was picked up unconscious and
taken to the hospital at Servignano. There he was given
electric treatment, and in a period of 18 days recovered his
speech, passing through a phase of stammering. He was
sent to a special hospital in Florence, still deaf, and passed
into a state of mental excitement with visual hallucinations
of soldiers. He was given chloral and bromide. He insisted
that he was incurably deaf. August 22, he was admitted
to Buscaino’s clinic, completely deaf, slightly stuporous,
somewhat indifferent, and innocent of any effort to
make himself understood (contrary to the habits of an organically
deaf person). Simulation could be excluded. It
was possible to awaken the patient during sleep by auditory
stimuli, whereupon he opened his eyes but could not hear.
He talked well and spontaneously, telling about his accident,
reading and answering by signs. He was assured,&mdash;always
in writing,&mdash;that upon the following Sunday his hearing
would be restored. Upon that day, during the visit of a
lady,&mdash;one of the patient’s friends,&mdash;hearing was suddenly
and almost completely restored in the left ear. The patient
was so moved by this that he cried when the physician came.
Upon the following day, he gradually began to hear with his
right ear. A slight diminution of hearing in the right ear
persisted, however, until September 24, and was associated
with headache and pains in the left ear&mdash;pains which the
patient compared to his ear pains in childhood (remains of
otitis with retraction of the tympanic membrane).</p>

could still move his legs in bed normally, but had absolute

case of cure of emotional mutism. This robust young
soldier at Verdun was buried by the explosion of a shell and
was thereafter found unable to speak. A week later he
arrived at the ambulance in the interior, and was still mute.
He could understand what was said to him without difficulty,
and was able to reply by signs. He did not even move the
lips when requested to pronounce such words as <i>mamma</i> and
<i>papa</i>, but was eventually induced to whisper these words.</p>

<p>The laryngoscope showed complete paralysis of the vocal
cords, which were in extreme abduction (it was possible to
see several tracheal rings). There was no reaction on the
part of the pharyngeal mucosa upon stimulation.</p>

<p>A fortnight passed without restoration of speech, though at
one time, not having bolted the closet door, the patient was
startled when a nurse rushed in, and he said, “Oh, pardon,
Madam.” The mutism persisted. He was then given work
in the vineyard, plenty of wine to drink, and hard work.
After a time (not specified) speech suddenly returned. According
to this correspondent, “this indeed is a universal
experience, namely, that hard manual work is the best
remedy for such functional incapacities of traumatic origin.”</p>

<h4><b>Case 483.</b> (<span class="smcap">Binswanger</span>, July, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A soldier, 26, without heredity, always well, in long
marches and several battles early in the war, August 23
sustained slight shell wounds of thighs and left upper arm.
He was unconscious about five minutes. In eight days, the
wounds were healed, and all movements were free.</p>

<p>Immediately after the trauma the arms trembled, and at
times the legs. Treatment was instituted (baths, drugs,
massage, electricity), but without result. After a month’s
treatment and a furlough at home, the patient was sent,
January 3, 1915, to the Jena Nerve Hospital. He was a
powerful man of middle size, with some small movable scars
on the left upper arm, remains of the shell injury; two
similar scars of the gluteus maximus. The deep reflexes
were slightly exaggerated, as were the skin reflexes. The
touch and pain sense in the left arm was absent as far as the
shoulder in typical segmental fashion. Arm movements
were free; there was an occasional tremor in both arms,
especially the left. This tremor would pronouncedly increase
upon intentional movements and with emotion.</p>

<p>He said that about two weeks before, at home, he had
waked up in the night and lain down on the floor beside
his bed, feeling giddy in his head. In a week the tremors
had diminished, leaving only a very slight tremor of the left
hand. The patient went to considerable pains to conceal
his tremor, holding his hand in a military position at the
seam of the trousers, on the medical visit. Sometimes he
would succeed in making the tremor quite disappear. February
5, he was busy about the ward work, going errands
and carrying trays. He would intentionally spare his left
hand in this work. Upon trying gymnastic exercises, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_686" id="Page_686">[686]</a></span>
tremors of the left hand and also of the right reappeared.
After a few days these tremors again disappeared, only to
come back on the 12th, when there was a constant tremor
also when the patient was at rest. He had been affected
when observing another patient (8<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>). Accordingly, he was
separated from this patient and put in a psychiatric ward.
The tremor remained of varying intensity, sometimes being
absent for hours together.</p>

<p>Request for furlough at the beginning of March was refused
with the statement that it would be granted when cure
was complete. The patient was inaccessible to psychotherapeutic
influence. He was always of a friendly, modest demeanor,
sleeping well, and performing all bodily functions
properly. On any exertion the pulse ran to 134. The
heart was normal. There were outbreaks of perspiration.</p>

31, the tremor was found to have quite disappeared. Upon
his return, April 12, there was a marked tremor of the left
arm, especially of the wrist joint, which again disappeared
after some days. The middle of June he was released as
capable of garrison duty with the recruits.</p>

<p>If there was a mechanical factor in this case, it must have
been the shaking-up of the body by the shell explosion. His
skin lesions were slight. The main factor was doubtless the
emotional shock. The tremor supervened upon a very brief
period of unconsciousness. It is hard, according to Binswanger,
to explain the localization of the cutaneous anesthesia
without the development of a corresponding paresis.
May it be, inquires Binswanger, that the wound of the left
upper arm at the moment of the setting-in of unconsciousness,
or perhaps at the moment of waking from unconsciousness,
directed the mind forthwith upon the left arm and in
this way produced localized disorder of sensation? If so,
why did the wound of the gluteal region not produce corresponding
disorders of feeling and sensation of an hysterical
nature? The obstinacy of the disease stands in striking disproportion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_687" id="Page_687">[687]</a></span>
to the slightness of the causative factors at
work.</p>

<p>According to Binswanger, this is perhaps due to the long
furlough which the patient had. According to Binswanger’s
experience, as that of many others, home works badly for
these hysterical patients; their friends sympathize with them
too much.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> furloughs, Ballard states that severe Shell-shock cases
should get analogous treatment to that of civilian psychoneurotics,
namely, a complete removal from the environment
in which the illness began. He advocates three months’
leave, after which the man is to be sent to a convalescent
home, and thence to a command dépôt. He states that if a
relapse then occurs, such a patient will never be a soldier.
Ballard would allow the men to walk about with their “pals
(not with escorts).” Cimbal remarks that German data
show that home furloughs should be avoided in every instance
where possible. Fiessinger remarks, on the basis of
English experience, that a Shell-shock patient treated by
rest, suggestion, and manual occupation may go back to the
line “and on a subsequent occasion prove a hero.” (See
<a href="#case474">Case 474</a> of Gilles.) But Forsyth remarks that it is probably
injudicious to send any cases of Shell-shock, with few
exceptions, back to the firing line, because their fighting
value has been permanently deteriorated, and because, if the
fear of return to the trenches is removed, recovery is more
rapid. The experience here is not unlike that of industrial
accident board cases with rapid recovery after the decree of
compensation.</p>

<p>War stress in a volunteer banker: Hysterical
seizures. Treatment by hydrotherapy.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 484.</b> (<span class="smcap">Hirschfeld</span>, February, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A banker, a volunteer (articular rheumatism at three
years; at 18, some form of lung and tracheal inflammation;
tendency to fainting spells on cold days&mdash;heart disease was
said to have been found), as a result of the strain and excitement
of the war had hysterical attacks during a fortnight
before observation in hospital, consisting of sensations suddenly
developing in the region of the heart, stiffness of the
whole body, disorders of movement, without loss of consciousness.</p>

<p>November 23, 1914, he was examined in bed in the dorsal
position, with the muscles of the legs, back, and neck in a
state of tonic contraction. He was unable to answer questions.
The pupil reactions were normal in the seizure. The
attack ceased in two minutes, as the result of hitting heavy
blows on the chest with a moist handkerchief and the threat
of a strong and painful application of the electric current.
The patient then got out of bed at request, walked about a
little incoördinately for a time, but after a few minutes was
able to walk perfectly and to talk once more.</p>

<p>Examined, November 25, he was found to be pale, fairly
well nourished, with a somewhat accelerated pulse, and a
melancholy, slightly apathetic expression. A systolic murmur
at the right apex; accentuation of secondary pulmonary
sound; increased knee-jerks; trembling of the lids
(Rosenbach).</p>

<p>By December 12, the patient was completely well. The
seizures had not recurred. The treatment was by hydrotherapy.
A preliminary treatment is advocated by Hirschfeld,
to insure peripheral circulation, either by light
baths, hot douches, or packs. More important than this
preliminary treatment is the cooling off process by means of
tepid douches or partial baths. These partial baths are
given at 28°C. for the intense effect of the cold. Sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_689" id="Page_689">[689]</a></span>
this treatment can be concluded with a dry pack. The
patients are treated by Hirschfeld three times a week with
both the warming and the cooling procedure.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> hydrotherapy, Mott has found the continuous warm
bath of great value in Shell-shock cases coming back from
France. He keeps the patient in the water from a quarter
to three-quarters of an hour, or longer. A warm bath and
a drink of warm milk at bedtime may permit a man to get
on without hypnotics, or to get on with lesser amounts of
hypnotics. The effect of these baths is doubtless largely
somatic. Some writers stress the suggestive value of hydrotherapy
as well as of electricity, radiant heat baths, and the
like (Ballard). A neuropsychiatric center properly equipped
with a hydrotherapeutic plant can do therapeutic work by
means of the suggestion afforded by a cold shower, which
may act quasi miraculously, like electricity (Roussy and
Boisseau). In fatigue and exhaustion cases, along with adrenalin
and strychnin, Aimé gives mild hydrotherapy without
other sedatives. Laehr’s free sanatorium at Schönow treats
the arrhythmia and tachycardia cases with rest and hydrotherapy.</p>

<p>Brasch reports rather poor results with hydrotherapy in
the cardiac neuroses. Weichardt has used the continuous
bath as a form of psychotherapy and permits the symptoms
of psychoneurosis to subside therein.</p>

<p>Shell-shock: low blood pressure: Pituitrin.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 485.</b> (<span class="smcap">Green</span>, September, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A lance corporal of the Expeditionary Force, 26, went to
France feeling very fit, February, 1916. He was blown up by
a shell July 1, and faintly remembered crawling out of some
water. He came to in a dugout, dumb and partially deaf,
and was blind for a few minutes. August 17, he was admitted
to Mott’s wards at Maudsley, mute but with hearing
normal. The hands were dusky, sweating, cold, and slightly
tremulous. He was given to battle dreams and used to
wake in a sweat and terror after a pantomime of bomb-throwing.
He had headache and was depressed. He complained
of feeling cold and the surface temperature was
subnormal. The blood pressure was also subnormal (according
to Green, nightmares are most marked in cases with low
blood pressure; these are, in fact, severer cases of Shell-shock
than cases with high blood pressure; only 10 of 27 cases with
blood pressure above 120 showed nightmares).</p>

<p>September 25, he was able to speak in a whisper. The
dreams had become less terrifying. The other symptoms
had been slowly improving.</p>

<p>November 25-28, all of the symptoms returned upon hearing
the death of his brother in action.</p>

<p>The man was now put on extract of pituitrin gr. 2, t.d.s.
(better results are claimed by Green from pituitrin extract
than from pituitary fluid injections, as these sometimes cause
dizziness, of which no case treated with extract complained).
As in other cases, the extract was immediately followed by
an increase in blood pressure, a general improvement and a
diminution of headache and depression. The bomb-throwing
pantomimes still persisted, but the patient was less weak
on waking. The treatment was continued for seven days,
whereupon the surface temperature began to rise and the
patient himself felt that he was much warmer. The pituitrin
was discontinued after a month’s treatment, yet the improvement
persisted. The man was boarded out of the army
and in March, 1917, wrote that he was still feeling better.</p>

<p>Various treatments of a contracture of hand.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 486.</b> (<span class="smcap">Duvernay</span>, November, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A chasseur, 22, received a bullet wound in the anatomical
snuffbox, the bullet emerging under the styloid process of
the radius, having traversed the back of the hand without
striking bone. Healing was rapid, but the hand assumed a
peculiar position. The second and third phalanges of the
fingers were extended, whereas the first phalanx was flexed.
The four fingers were as if glued together. Both phalanges
of the thumb were flexed, the wrist was in extension, and
the tendon of the palmaris seemed contractured. The
fingers could not be moved and the wrist was very mobile.
There was pain on attempts to move the hand passively,
and small clonic contractions were made by the fingers.
There were no sensory disorders, but there was a maceration
of the interdigital spaces.</p>

<p>Mechanotherapy accelerated the contracture, and massage,
motor reëducation, bromides, and sedative drugs, had
no effect. Under kelene-anesthesia the contracture would
disappear. In January, 1915, the hand was put up in plaster
in a position opposite to the contracture. The intense
pain of the first days was treated by opium. The patient
was sent on leave, and, at the end of two months, the plaster
was removed; but the hand at once resumed its faulty
position, and attempts to alter its position again provoked
pain. Elastic traction was then tried for six weeks, and the
bad position was somewhat modified but not improved by
hyperextending the second phalanx on the first, and putting
the third in slight flexion on the second. Hot compresses
were unsuccessful also. May 14, 1915, the position was still
irreducible; there was no R. D. or electrical hyperexcitability.
This was not a question of radial paralysis, since finger
extension was distinct; nor a paralysis of the median, since
the thumb was flexed. The contracture, in fact, does not
affect a special nerve territory, and the disorder is in the
ulnar, radial, and median territories.</p>

<p>Orthopedic case.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 487.</b> (<span class="smcap">Sollier</span>, November, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A patient suffered from a rupture of the peroneal nerve in
its lower part, September, 1915, and had operation scars
before and behind the external malleolus. He was immobilized
for 45 days at first, and then for 30 days, with the foot
in extension on account of the pain produced in the endeavor
to put it into normal position. A 6 cm. atrophy was then
found to affect the calf, and there was a fibrous retraction
of the tendo Achillis and of the calf muscles. There was
no anesthesia, the toes moved easily, the foot was fixed in
equinus, with about 7 cm. of the heel above the ground. He
was placed in various orthopedic institutions and was treated
with mechanotherapy, but without result.</p>

<p>At the neurological center, however, in six weeks, he was got
to walk, with his heel on the ground, by means of massage and
manual mobilization. The atrophy diminished a centimeter
and the foot became mobile in all directions.</p>

<p>According to Sollier, mechanotherapy by means of apparatus
is apt to be ineffective, especially in contractures, because
its action ceases the moment it ought to commence,
namely, when the patient is beginning to react a little painfully
after recovery from anesthesia. In cases of retraction,
mechanotherapy with apparatus does not allow the proper
combination of massage with progressive mobilization.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> orthopedic cases, Jones classes the conditions that
create an orthopedic case under four heads (note especially
the fourth):</p>

<p>1. Mechanical injury to bone, joint, muscle, or nerve.</p>

<p>2. Atrophy and disease of these structures primarily due
to the injury.</p>

<p>3. Incoördination of movement due to disease of the
brain&mdash;a result of atrophy and disease of peripheral
structures.</p>

<p>4. Psychological conditions which can be overcome by
reëducational processes.</p>

<p>Favorable effects of lumbar puncture.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 488.</b> (<span class="smcap">Ravaut</span>, August, 1915.)</h4>

<p>An accountant, 20, in the 135th infantry sustained shock
from mine explosion near his trench, March 6. He was
kept two days at the relief station. March 8, at the
ambulance, he did not appear to understand questions and
had a fixed stare. He complained of a violent headache and
kept pressing his head between his hands. He kept looking
about him anxiously, and the slightest noise made him jump.
He would mutter a few incomprehensible words, and in reply
to a question would give only the last phrase which he happened
to have been saying. Lumbar puncture showed a
very slight excess of albumin. Next day, he answered his
name. March 12, he could speak in monosyllables, and he
began to understand what was said. After the lumbar
puncture, the headache disappeared and did not set in again.
March 13, he began to be able to write and say short phrases.
March 16, expression was good though hesitant, and the
patient wrote a letter to his parents, telling about his shock.
Lumbar puncture showed that the albumin was now normal.
From the rear, April 5, the patient sent Ravaut a postcard
in perfect form, telling how he was ready to go back to the
front.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> lumbar puncture, Imboden quotes Podmanizky as having
used lumbar puncture as a method of suggestion for the
cure of abasia. See also cases 560 and 561, in which Claude
cured two cases of dysbasia by the device of stovaine anesthesia
of the spinal cord. Pastine also has a case in which
a slight improvement was produced on removal of cerebrospinal
fluid, and a sudden and complete cure was brought
about by the second puncture, a very painful tap. Pastine’s
case is thought by him (1916) to be in part at least organic.</p>

<p>Bullet wound of forearm: Hysterical clenching
of fist. Recovery by fatiguing the flexors.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 489.</b> (<span class="smcap">Reeve</span>, September, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A soldier, 28, was thrice wounded between August 18, 1914,
and July 14, 1916. The third time, a bullet passed through
the fleshy part of the forearm, whereupon the hand became
clenched and remained so after the wound was surgically
healed. As a case of war neurosis, the man was treated by
electricity, massage, passive movements, and fixation in a
straight splint during a period of nine months, without result.
He was admitted to Maghull Military Hospital, April 18, 1917.</p>

<p>Two days after admission a treatment was given whose
principle consists in producing a condition of fatigue in the
muscles responsible for contracture. This fatigue is produced
by continuous passive movements in a direction opposed to
the normal action of the muscles in question. Many hours of
forcible movement are sometimes necessary in the case of the
more powerful muscles before the limp, toneless fatigue condition
is brought about. Relays of men are told off for this
purpose. Patients are got to assist in the work, particularly
such as have been cured by the treatment. Also, the
patient is himself told about the nature of spasms and the
relief which the method will bring. This patient was told
that after the flexor muscles were fatigued they would no
longer be able to pull the fingers into the clenched position,
whereupon the antagonistic muscles on the back of the forearm
would begin to work.</p>

<p>The fingers were forcibly opened without interruption for
six hours, in each case as soon as the fingers closed into the
palm. In a few hours they began to return more slowly, and
at the end of the six hours remained extended. The extended
position was still found the following morning. The extensor
muscles were feeble in action, but improved day by day.
The spasm did not return. The patient was discharged
July 2, 1917, about two and a half months after admission to
Maghull. The hand was now strong and useful.</p>

<p>Bullet through shoulder girdle: Hysterical adduction
of arm. Treatment by induced fatigue.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 490.</b> (<span class="smcap">Reeve</span>, September, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A man, 29, was in hospital more than two years before the
Reeve fatigue treatment was applied to a functional contracture.
This man had a bullet pass through the right
scapula and out the pectoralis major, June 4, 1915, was (according
to patient’s story) operated two months later, then
further operated for drainage of septic wounds, and from
August, 1915, had his arm fixed to the side, going into spasm
at any attempt to move it passively. The elbow was extended
and at first the fingers were tightly flexed and wrist
extended. The finger flexion and wrist flexion cleared in
March, 1917, and recurred in May. Electrical massage in
June, 1917, yielded free movement, but the spasm returned.</p>

<p>The man was admitted to Maghull, June 12, 1917, that is, a
little over two years after his injury. The arm sprang back to
the side like a clasp knife on being released. The wrist and
fingers were moved freely. Three days after admission the
elbow was forcibly flexed for some hours, whereupon the spasm
disappeared. Next day the arm was forcibly abducted and
reabducted: for four or five hours the arm could be voluntarily
abducted. Two assistants were necessary, such was
the force of the adductor contraction. At the end of a
week the patient was found able to lift his hand to the back
of his head. There was no longer spasm.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> abrupt treatments, amongst which Reeve’s treatment
by induced fatigue may be counted, Babinski and Froment
consider that abrupt treatment is far superior to slower
psychotherapy combined with isolation, whether or not we
are dealing with a recent or an old disease. So far as psychotherapy
goes, Babinski wants to obtain a definite improvement,
if not a cure, on the first application of treatment.
According to Babinski, the patient’s faith in his
physician’s power to cure him is most active at this first
meeting, whose emotionality favors the cure.</p>

<p>A man, 32, was buried by a shell and bruised about the
back, August 2, 1916. He was bedfast until February, 1917.
Every attempt to move the legs brought on tremors. He was
then allowed up; but the attempt to walk caused one foot
to knock the other, and his ankles became bruised, necessitating
cotton wool pads for feet.</p>

<p>He was admitted to Maghull, June 12, with one leg crossed
over the other and the thigh adductors spastic, especially
on the right.</p>

<p>The fatigue treatment was carried out in dorsal decubitus,
each leg being pulled by a man, and the separation repeated
when necessary. Four hours a day for three days of this
work finally reduced the spasm so that the patient was able
to walk with assistance. On the sixth day he walked a mile
without assistance. The spasm has not returned.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> leg contractures, Bérard got successful results by continuous
extension combined with injections of 1 per cent
novocain into the sciatic nerve trunk and the contractured
muscles. According to Babinski and Froment, there ought
to be an almost certain cure of any genuine hysterical state.
They quote the observations of Souques, Meige, Albert
Charpentier, Clovis Vincent, Roussy, and Léri as proving
this claim.</p>

<p>The Reeve method, so far as it is psychotherapeutic, bears
a resemblance to Clovis Vincent’s first stage of what the
poilu calls <i>torpillage</i>, namely, the stage of crisis and of intensive
reëducation. But Clovis Vincent uses in his direct
and forcible reëducation the galvanic current.</p>

<h4><b>Case 493.</b> (<span class="smcap">Reeve</span>, September, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A man, 24, buried by a shell, February, 1915, had had a
functional “claw foot” for more than two years, cured by
the Reeve fatigue treatment in less than a week. According
to Reeve, claw foot is perhaps the most common of the war
contractures, particularly intractable, and often seen out of
hospital with an “inside splint.”</p>

<p>After his burial this man could not walk, had tremors, was
in bed for four months and on getting up showed strongly inverted
foot. Three months’ splint treatment, strong faradic
currents, massage, passive movements, special boots with
leather wedges to tilt the foot over, were methods of treatment
tried, but unsuccessful. At Maghull from November
18, 1916, he was treated by exercises, passive movements,
suggestive and reëducative measures, and after a few months
got about without sticks.</p>

<p>The claw foot continued. Toward the end of June, 1917,
the feet were forcibly flexed and everted for eight hours. The
deformity disappeared, but returned slightly next day. Further
fatigue treatment for eight hours caused the spasm to
cease permanently. He was discharged quite normal, July
20, 1917. Reeve remarks that this fatigue method might
be applicable to certain hysterical contractures in civil practice.</p>

<p>A soldier (brother choreic, sister infantile palsy) had had
measles at 13 and in his fever climbed out of bed upon a
couch, fell from the couch and was found by his mother
lying on the floor. He was of moderate intellectual grade,
of an emotional, passionate Saxon nature and had now and
then been intoxicated.</p>

<p>In September, 1914, he was wounded over the right eye.
He did not lose consciousness but concluded that he could
not get back to his own lines on account of the enemy fire.
Using a knapsack to cover his head, he lay down for twenty-four
hours, until rescued by a passing body of the sanitary
corps who were about to leave him for dead when he called
loudly to them.</p>

<p>He was very weak in hospital and, towards the evening of
the day after receiving his injury, he must have fallen into
some sort of psychotic state lasting ten days. For this he
remained quite amnestic, although he was told by comrades
that he had hallucinations and had scolded and yelled, hearing
voices. Apparently there were situation-deliria&mdash;the
call to go over the top. Temperature, which had run to 38.8,
after ten days sank to normal, and consciousness cleared up.</p>

<p>Was this a case of protracted febrile delirium? Or of
psychosis due to <i>commotio cerebri</i>, that is, an effect of heightened
intracranial pressure? Or was it exhaustion-delirium
following loss of blood, sleep and food?</p>

<p>But this was not the end. The wound suppurated, and
in May, 1915, eight months after the injury, operation was
performed to relieve this abscess. Temperature immediately
rose to from 38.4 to 38.6, the fever lasting three days,
and a second psychotic phase with complete amnesia entered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_700" id="Page_700">[700]</a></span>
He went into this phase immediately after recovering from
the operative narcosis, looking wildly about and cursing the
sister. The patient was violently excited and was put in a
straight jacket on the second day. This phase may be regarded
as one of epileptiform excitement with delirium. The
operation may have played a part in the psychosis.</p>

<p>There were no further psychotic phenomena which could
be attributed in any way to <i>commotio</i>. There were, however,
attacks of cortical origin and emotional seizures. The
patient became emotionally excitable and lost all inhibitions
against expression of emotion, such as crying. Once he actually
tried to suppress his emotion with a noose about his
throat. He became seclusive and withdrew within himself&mdash;a
victim of Kaplan’s explosive diathesis, or of Bonhoeffer’s
emotional hyperesthetic defect condition.</p>

<p>A second operation was performed in September, 1916,
to loosen the brain scar, and a large splinter of bone was
removed. During the operation, under local anesthesia,
there was a severe cortical seizure with complete disappearance
of the reflexes. Ether was then administered. Later,
in the same day, there were several minor cortical attacks.</p>

<p>After this operation the man’s emotional status changed;
he was no longer irritable or exclusive, but became slightly
euphoric and contented. He received during the next two
weeks four tablets of Sedobrol and for a long time thereafter
two tablets daily. There were never any phenomena of
bromidism or any suggestive effects of the bromides.</p>

<p>The first attack after the second operation came in November,
1916, and was followed by slight dysarthria. Repeated
attacks followed which were attributed to contractions in the
scar. Accordingly, a third operation was performed and an
attempt was made to bridge over a defect in the right frontal
bone. The man’s emotional status remained good after the
operation, but further attacks appeared six weeks later and
there were spells of dizziness. Occasionally, in process of
thinking, he said something stuck in between his thoughts.
Sometimes thinking broke off sharply as if he had cut through
a wire with an electrical current in it. There was a slight
reduction in attention and a slightly increased fatiguability.</p>

<p>Hard service; shell explosion with loss of teeth:
Vomiting. Cure by restoration of self-confidence.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 495.</b> (<span class="smcap">McDowell</span>, January, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A married reservist was called up at the outbreak of the
war and went through Mons, the Marne, and the Aisne and
was finally blown up by a shell at Ypres. Early in November,
1914, he lost his speech but got it back in time to get
home for Christmas. A number of teeth had been lost in the
injury. Vomiting began first in England. While on leave
at home he vomited at every meal. Asked whether it was
his food or his thoughts, he said, “You are quite correct,
Sir, you know I have always been with thinking.”</p>

<p>Under medical care, June, 1915, he was found suffering
from hesitating speech, general tremulousness and emotionality.
He worried a great deal on account of money matters
at home. He lay awake thinking. A child became ill and
died, and all the while he got worse, “thinking all the time.”</p>

<p>It was explained to him that the vomiting was a matter of
emotions. The lost teeth were replaced by false ones. As he
began to get control of his emotions, he vomited less and increased
in weight. Finally he was boarded for discharge and
was sick again on the day of the meeting. A fortnight later
when sent to sign discharge papers he vomited once more.</p>

<p>According to McDowell, the vagus may possibly be incriminated
as a cause of these gastric disturbances. Practically,
the vomiting is a result of emotional stress. The
cure is to produce insight on the part of the patient, the removal
of worry and the restoration of self-confidence.</p>

<p>Michell Clarke cured such cases with milk diet.</p>

<p>Roussy and Lhermitte find hysterical vomiting to be relatively
common and as a rule without difficulty in diagnosis;
but they remark that there is often some underlying organic
condition to be sought for and treated after the neuropathic
element has vanished. They remark, also, that there is no
tendency to spontaneous cure of the disease. They advocate
a strict dietetic régime and psychotherapy.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="case496">
<p>Cure of self-accusatory (“started retreat from
Mons”) and other delusions by “autognosis.”</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 496.</b> (<span class="smcap">Brown</span>, January, 1916.)</h4>

<p>Capt. William Brown, in the discussion at the Section of
Psychiatry of the Royal Society of Medicine, January 25,
1916, speaks of a method of treatment which he calls <i>autognosis</i>&mdash;a
method of giving the patient self-knowledge, by
revealing to the patient through his own confessions the
cause of mental change leading to his symptoms. One of
Brown’s examples is that of a sergeant in the firing-line
during the retreat from Mons. He was admitted to Maghull
with the delusion that people thought he had given the signal
for the retreat from Mons on a silver whistle, a shooting prize
of his. German officers used silver whistles that made a
note like his own. In fact, he had other like delusions, such
as that people thought him responsible for an Edinburgh
railroad accident in connection with his troop-train. A
German spy might have heard this.</p>

<p>In the process of procuring autognosis, Capt. Brown found
that at the age of 12 this man had been falsely accused of
stealing pork pies from a shop, and had been brought before
a magistrate. In point of fact, he proved an alibi, but he was
greatly worried by the charge. According to Capt. Brown,
this incident of the insistence of the false accusation was the
beginning of his tendency to delusions. In two months’ time
there was a remarkable improvement.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> psychoanalysis, autognosis and various modifications,
Forsyth remarks that when the acute stage is passed, the
Shell-shock case becomes an everyday neurosis in which war
experiences are merely the latest phases in the patient’s
life, and that psychoanalysis may then become necessary.
Eder regards the “mechanisms” of what he terms “war
shock” as the Freudian mechanisms of hysteria, and has
commended psychoanalysis for a few cases, preferring hypnotism
for acute cases. Adrian and Yealland decry psychoanalysis
on the score of time limitations.</p>

<p>Deafmutism in three men shell-shocked at one
time.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Cases 497, 498, 499.</b> (<span class="smcap">Roussy</span>, April, 1915.)</h4>

<p>There were three Zouaves in a first-line trench north of
Arras, January 14, 1915, who were blown up by a bomb thrown
from the enemy trench some hundreds of meters away, by a
mortar, a <i>crapouillaud</i>. This projectile burst with a great
noise, louder than that of a bomb, and made a very strong
windage. A dozen men were blown under the trench wall,
just after entering the trench; two were killed; and the
others, most of whom had been buried to the neck, were
pulled out and carried, trembling, to the nearest relief post.
Two of the three Zouaves were bleeding at nose and ears, and
all three were absolutely deaf and mute. Evacuated to an
ambulance, and thence to Paris, they arrived at Val-de-Grâce,
January 17, that is to say, three days after the shell burst.
They communicated with the attendants by signs; one got
hold of paper and wrote several hours in the day rapid notes
about the accident. However, hysteria or pure simulation
was suspected in these three Zouaves, and they were placed in
small separate rooms. They were informed through the
physician’s remarks to his staff that these were cases of nothing
but simple nervous shock such as we had often observed,
and the claim was made that they would be completely well
either on the morrow or the day after.</p>

<p>On the morrow, two of them partially recovered hearing
and got back their voices. They became loquacious and
began to tell about the battle. The day after, the third
patient began to speak. Two of them showed traces of
auricular hemorrhage, and in fact, actual ear lesions were
found in all three. One had a suppurative right middle ear,
with perforation; another had both drums perforated and a
suppurative middle ear, also on both sides. The third, who
recovered his speech after the others, had perforation of the
left tympanum with a little suppuration of the right ear
tympanum and a slight tear of the right tympanum. In
April, 1915, the hearing was cured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_704" id="Page_704">[704]</a></span></p>

<p>These men had been under fire several months, and had
taken part in the battle of the Marne. It was not a question
of their first baptism of fire, and in fact, each of them had
been previously wounded. According to Roussy, the story
is, that the shell-burst produces by displacement of air tympanic
perforation, and at the same time a violent nerve
shock with loss of consciousness for a few minutes. The
men come to, but the ear lesion, probably exaggerated by the
nervous status of its bearer, creates a complete bilateral deafness.
This deafness produces an absolute hysterical mutism.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> case groups of war neurosis, several writers speak of
dangers of contagion, but also emphasize the values of contact
of patients with one another in the securing of therapeutic
results. What Mott has termed the <i>atmosphere of
cure</i> was no doubt present in the three instances of Roussy
just cited. The cure of one may act heterosuggestively to
produce the cure of a second, and so on. Functional deafmutes
are somewhat refractory as a rule. H. Campbell
states that there is some danger attached to allowing large
numbers of functional cases to consort together too closely.
He suggests making use of small wards and screens, and a
process of sorting out patients so that they shall not affect
one another injuriously. Steiner especially stresses the value
of individual rooms in preventing psychic infection, of
which, he says, the danger is large in open dormitories. The
psychic contagion is as a rule that of hysterical seizures and
tremors; but complaints about faulty hospital arrangements
are also readily spread. Steiner advocates never
questioning a nervous patient concerning his troubles in the
presence of other soldiers. To reach 60 to 70 patients,
Steiner had one examining and treatment room. Roussy’s
institution at Salins in 1917 had a service limited to traumatic
hysteria, from which, in three months’ time, 200 subjects had
been discharged cured (see Boschi).</p>

<p>Dysentery: Milk diet persisted in: Vomiting, incontinence,

</div>

<h4><b>Case 500.</b> (<span class="smcap">McDowell</span>, December, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A soldier, 25, a low menial when war broke out, developed
“dysentery and gastritis” at the Dardanelles, although
even before the dysentery his nerves had gone bad. He had
diarrhoea and vomiting, was sick every day, found himself
unable to walk, and found himself always wet with urine
dribbling day and night. Arriving in England and treated
in a hospital, he still had vomiting. He had lived on milk
and custard and been kept in bed.</p>

<p>Capt. McDowell convinced the patient that his legs were
not as weak as he supposed. He was encouraged to walk,
put upon light diet and then upon ordinary diet. He became
an active worker in the ward, later going for five-mile
route marches. Two months later he went back to duty in
good health, weighing seven pounds more than before. This
man was weakminded and, when his dysentery was cured,
did not dare to start eating ordinary food. He was a victim
of hospital régime. Individual attention would have obviated
much of the subsequent state.</p>

<p>An officer and his servant were blown up by a shell. The

much attached, but on his return the officer made a few

<h4><b>Case 502.</b> (<span class="smcap">Roussy</span>, April, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A soldier in the artillery, who had been in the lines from
August as a kitchenman, looking after the food of the first
line trenches, with which his shelter was connected by communication
trenches, 800 meters away, was on January 17,
1915, with three other men placed in the shelter kitchen of
the trenches but a short distance away from the French artillery.
The firing passed over the heads of these men but
they could feel the windage, which obliged them to lie down
each time. The evening of that day, several hours after
firing had ceased, the kitchenman had a shivering spell, with
trembling that lasted all night; after which these crises came
on every day. He had finally to be evacuated to the rear.</p>

<p>According to Roussy, such patients always have neuropathic
taint and a history of previous crises. Such a patient
ought to be handled with rather severe discipline. In this
way, according to Roussy, the reappearance of a severe attack
of convulsions can be prevented. But these patients cannot
go back to the front.</p>

<p>A man on crutches, paralyzed completely in the right leg,
partially in the left, developed paralysis in the right arm
from the use of the crutch. There were marked vasomotor
changes in the right leg and arm together with anesthesia
to pinprick. Assured that he could move the legs perfectly
he said that he had tried and failed. After a persuasive talk
in private he began to use the arm, and to walk perfectly.
It seems that in the trenches he had a sharp pain in the
right knee, after which he did not use the leg and it gradually
became more and more useless. It had been paralyzed for
three months. The reason he did not use this leg was not
on his own account, but on account of his mother at home.
He seemed really grateful for the cure.</p>

The functional nature of his shaking was explained to him

<p>Hard patrol work: Delirium; head tremor augmented

</div>

<h4><b>Case 505.</b> (<span class="smcap">Binswanger</span>, July, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A metal moulder in civil life, 29, in military service 1907
to 1909 (no hereditary taint, moderately good scholar),
became unconscious for a half hour after taking a cold drink
following a somewhat long practice march, at some time during
his first year of military service.</p>

<p>He was in several skirmishes in Belgium and Northern
France early in the war, being once surrounded in patrol
work (November 11) by Turcoes and Zouaves. There was
a lively exchange of shots, in the course of which five of
the eight men on patrol fell. The three survivors hid themselves
for three days in a quarry, and on the fourth were
found by the advancing troops, and immediately went into
battle.</p>

<p>But during a pause while on the point of taking coffee, the
man suddenly fell sick, tried to carry on, but lost consciousness
and apparently remained unconscious for about three-quarters
of an hour. It seems that he raved and shouted
and tried to bite his fingers, being held with great difficulty
by several comrades. He was removed to a dressing-station
three km. distant.</p>

<p>At the dressing-station, his head began to shake, although
he was unaware of this until his attention was called to it by
his comrades. He said that he felt restless and that his head
ached almost continually. He was carried to the reserve
hospital, and from thence, December 9, 1914, to the nerve
hospital at Jena, where he was unaware of the shaking of his
head (which had now lasted for three weeks), and said that
he felt a thick fog in his head (to say nothing of headaches),
and was only free and clear in his head while standing in the
open air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_709" id="Page_709">[709]</a></span></p>

<p>His sleep was restless and poor; there were war dreams almost
every night. In the process of getting to sleep, his
arms and legs frequently twitched. He would soon tire and
feel weak. Also since his dangerous experience, he had
noticed a change in his speech: always fluent before, it was
now hard for him to speak because one had to exert one’s
head so much in speaking.</p>

<p>This head tremor was in fact the most marked symptom
of his illness. It would increase on every active motion of
the head, but ceased almost entirely when attention was diverted.
The head would then be held bent to the right.</p>

<p>During emotional excitement, the shaking spasm would
spread over the entire upper part of the body, but would
remain more severe upon the right than upon the left side.
The forearms would fall into a lively shaking movement of
pronation and supination. The hands and fingers would be
attacked by a less marked tremor. After calm had set in,
a fine tremor of the right hand would remain plainly noticeable.
The musculature of facial expression would frequently
fall into spasmodic movement, the left corner of the mouth
twitching, the lips set for whistling, or the upper lip making
movements as if snuffing spasmodically.</p>

<p>Physically the man was of medium height, strongly built,
with adherent lobules, and a somewhat pointed skull. The
teeth were defective and irregularly placed. Both deep and
skin reflexes were increased. Marked dermatographia and
mechanical excitability of the muscles: periosteal reflexes
strongly developed; numerous pressure points in the head.
The right temple and back of the head were painful on percussion.
The patient showed no disturbance in touch and
pain sensibility. Outstretched tongue showed marked fibrillary
twitching; speech was difficult, being slow, awkward,
stumbling, and sometimes hesitating (suggesting the speech
of general paresis). At other times, the speech was of a
peculiar sighing, tremulous nature, reminding one of the
speech of children complaining or asking for pity. Rest
was secured by injections of salt solution. A few days later,
the treatment was continued by a bandage about the neck.
After this the tremor grew slighter and would even remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_710" id="Page_710">[710]</a></span>
absent for some hours. The patient was told to rest in bed
and not to speak much; being “seriously ill,” he was kept
alone. He was often irritated, querulous, and subject to
outbursts of profanity. He took food well and slept well, receiving
sodium bicarbonate.</p>

<p>The bandage was changed after five days. The tremor was
very marked. The patient was furious because visitors were
refused to him. He was especially angry with his nearest
relatives and his betrothed, and wrote defiant letters to all
of them. He became one of the most troublesome patients
in the psychiatric division of the hospital. He complained
sometimes of anxiety and feelings of unrest. He received
treatment by pantopon. He continued to be a very disagreeable
patient, feeling himself opposed and not properly
considered. He thought himself seriously ill, behaved much
like a spoiled child, and was of the opinion that he would not
get well in the hospital because they were grieving him so.
His appetite became bad; he complained of pains in the
loins and of rheumatism in the legs. A cord was found
hidden in the bed. The patient expressed suicidal thoughts
at various times.</p>

<p>At the beginning of January there was marked improvement.
The headshaking ceased almost entirely; the patient walked
in the garden some hours daily. However, in the middle of
January, on refusal of furlough, the head-shaking began again
markedly. At his request a bandage was placed on the head
again for a few days. He seemed emotionally very tender;
his head would shake at the sight of a dead rabbit.</p>

<p>He was transferred to the nerve division of the psychiatric
clinic at the end of January. He had recently begun to
complain of flickering before the eyes. The ophthalmologists
established an existence of a choroiditis disseminata.
The eye examination had a markedly depressing effect upon
the patient, and the shaking spasm of the head appeared
again. Upon being told that he would have to be sent back
to the psychiatric section of the clinic, the shaking immediately
disappeared (24 hours after it had begun).</p>

<p>Thereafter slow improvement followed. He stayed in the
open a great deal and walked. March 2, he showed a vehement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_711" id="Page_711">[711]</a></span>
outburst of anger, quarreling and using violence
with a comrade. He was brought back to the psychiatric
section, and in transit had a severe hysterical attack with
unconsciousness, crying fits, and stepping movements of the
extremities. He was promptly taken to a section for those
seriously ill. The next day, upon his assurance that he could
control himself, he was put in a more quiet division. He
began to take part in gymnastic exercises, worked as a coachman,
and then as an experiment was sent to a gentleman’s
estate for recreation. At last accounts he was feeling well
except that he occasionally had headaches during work. He
could not work so hard as before on account of the rapid onset
of fatigue, especially when working in the sun. The head-shaking
recurred but seldom and lasted for a few hours only
when the patient became angry or when there was much noise
about.</p>

<h4><b>Case 506.</b> (<span class="smcap">Rivers</span>, February, 1918.)</h4>

<p>A young English officer was wounded just as he was extricating
himself from burial in a mass of earth. He became
nervous and sleepless and lost his appetite. After the
wound had healed, he was sent home on leave, which had to
be extended as he got worse. An out-patient in London for
a time, he was finally sent to a convalescent home, still
troubled with insomnia, battle dreams and concern about his
recovery. He made light of his condition and was on the
point of being returned to duty by the medical board, when
his sleeplessness led to his being sent to Craighlochart War
Hospital.</p>

<p>He could not sleep without a light in the room, else every
sound attracted his attention. He tried hard all day long to
banish all unpleasant and disturbing thoughts, but at night
it took him a long time to get to sleep and then came vivid
dreams of warfare. He did not, himself, feel that he could
ever forget the war scenes.</p>

<p>Rivers, in general believing that the attempt to banish
such experiences absolutely from the mind is poor psychotherapy,
narrated his views to the patient. Rivers advised
him no longer to try to banish the memories, but to try to
transform them into tolerable, if not pleasant, companions.
The war experiences and anxieties were talked over. That
night the man had the best night he had had for five months,
and during the following week the sleeplessness was no longer
so painful and distressing. If unpleasant thoughts came,
they had to do rather with home life than with the war.
General health improved; insomnia diminished. He was at
last able to return to duty.</p>

body blown to pieces, with head and limbs severed from
the trunk. This vision haunted him in dreams. Sometimes
the officer appeared as on the battlefield; again as
leprous. The officer would come nearer and nearer in the
dream, until the patient woke pouring with sweat and in
utmost terror. Accordingly, he was afraid to go to sleep,
and spent all day thinking painfully about the night to come.
Advice to keep all thoughts of war out of mind merely brought
the memories in sleep upon him with redoubled force and
horror.</p>

<p>Rivers’ therapy was to draw attention to the fact that the
terrible mangling proved conclusively that the officer had
been killed outright and without pain. The officer said he
would now no longer attempt to banish the thoughts and
memories of his friend, but would concentrate on the pain and
suffering his friend had been spared. No dreams at all came
for several nights, but one night in his dream he went out
into No-Man’s-Land and saw the mangled body, but without
horror. He knelt down, as he had in the original experience,
and woke as he was taking off the Sam Browne belt to send to
the relatives. A few nights later came another dream in
which he talked with his friend. There was but one more
dream in which horror occurred.</p>

<p>Rationalization of war memories: Eventually unfitted

</div>

<h4><b>Case 508.</b> (<span class="smcap">Rivers</span>, February, 1918.)</h4>

<p>A young English officer, after doing well for a period, was
rendered unconscious by shell explosion. The first thing he
remembered was being led by his servant towards his base,
thoroughly broken down. He had headaches, sleeplessness,
war dreams and spells of terrible depression appearing with
absolute suddenness, unlike ordinary “blues.” For ten days
in hospital no such attack appeared, but one evening he came
to Rivers pale and anxious. A few minutes before, he had
been writing a letter in his usual mood, when this causeless
depression came on. In the afternoon he had walked about
on some neighboring hills. The letter dealt with no depressing
matter. In ten minutes the depression vanished.
Nine days later another came as he was standing idly looking
out of a window. The attack lasted for several hours, as no
physician was present to meet the issue. If he had had a
revolver he would have shot himself.</p>

<p>Rivers was inclined to interpret these gusts of depression
as due to a forgotten but active experience. As there was
no definite tendency to dissociation, Rivers hesitated to
plunge in with the hypnotic method, nothing short of which,
however, served to recall the incident. The man was gravely
apprehensive about fitness for further service, and was repressing
his fear, as he thought it either was cowardice or
would be called cowardice. The patient, by his discussions
with Rivers, had already become familiar with the idea that
the gusts of depression might be due to a submerged experience.
Perhaps, however, there had been no experience,
and the patient was advised that possibly the thing repressed
was the idea about fitness for service. Accordingly, the
patient agreed to face the situation. One transient attack of
morbid depression occurred, after an operation. Then the
man fell into a state of anxiety neurosis such that he was
passed by a medical board as unfit for military service.</p>

</div>

<h4><b>Case 509.</b> (<span class="smcap">Rivers</span>, February, 1918.)</h4>

<p>An oldish English officer lost consciousness while looking
at the havoc wrought by shell explosion. Probably there was
a second shell that sent him off. He was eventually admitted
to an English hospital with paresis and anesthesia of legs,
severe headache, sleeplessness and terrifying dreams. Hypnotic
drugs and advice neither to read nor to talk about the
war were the measures adopted and after two months in
hospital he was given three months leave. He buried himself
in the heart of the country, away from relatives, with
aspirin and bromides. He began to sleep better and had
less headache. When the president of the medical board
asked a question about trenches at the end of his period of
leave, however, he broke down and wept. He again repaired
to the country for two months’ leave, for the chosen
treatment by isolation and repression.</p>

<p>An order was then given that all officers must be either
in hospital or on duty. He was sent to an inland watering
place and treated by baths, electricity and massage, whereupon
he rapidly became worse, especially as to sleep. He
was transferred to Craiglochart in an emaciated state, with
an expression of anxiety and dread, paresis of legs, sleeplessness
and war dreams.</p>

<p>He was now advised to give up repressing, to read and
talk a little about the war, and to accustom himself to thinking
about war experiences. He did this but half-heartedly,
as he thought the ideal treatment was what he had so long
followed. Nevertheless, he got distinctly better and the content
of the war dreams was altered to home scenes. He was
still loath to acknowledge his improvement and thought that
he would have recovered if he had not been taken from his
retreat and sent to hospital. As it was obvious that he
would be of no further use in the army, he was allowed to
relinquish his commission.</p>

<p>An English officer was flung by shell explosion so that his
face struck the ruptured and distended abdomen of a dead
German. The officer did not immediately lose consciousness
and got distinct impressions of taste and smell and an
idea of their source. After a period of unconsciousness he
came to, vomiting and much shaken. He carried on several
days, still troubled by vomiting and haunted by taste and
smell images. Several months later he was observed by
Rivers suffering from horrible dreams, in which the battle
experience was faithfully reproduced. He got no relief except
when he went into the country, far from every suggestion
of war. Rivers’ psychotherapeutic plan of finding a
redeeming feature in the experience, upon which the patient
might concentrate, failed because there was no redeeming
feature. Accordingly, it was thought best that the man
should leave the army and seek the conditions that had
given him slight relief.</p>

Boschi in his report on French conditions gives no

has found blended with the war dreams many episodes quite
alien to the war, and considers that the patient’s ante-bellum
history is of importance, since ante-bellum emotions may
be revivified by the war. Craig states that he has not been
impressed favorably by the results of psychoanalytic treatment.
Arinstein from Russian experience gives preference

<p>A soldier, 23, had fever with swelling of several joints
and temperature in 1915, and was furloughed to England.
He complained of pains in the limbs and shortness of breath,
and was put in hospital. As he did not improve, he was sent
to a special hospital for baths and electricity. There he
remained from August, 1915, to March, 1916, with D’Arsonval
baths, cataphoresis, electric treatment and massage.</p>

<p>He was now sent to the second Northern General Hospital
to see whether he should be discharged permanently unfit.
Here he shuffled along on two crutches, very tremulous, and
sweating, and suffering from palpitation on exertion. He
wanted to take poison if he could not be cured.</p>

<p>The crutches were taken away. He was asked to walk up
and down. He had to be supported at first and fell several
times. The exercises were continued. Massage and drugging
were stopped. The next day he was able to stand
alone. In twenty-four hours he walked by himself. The
other patients in the ward encouraged him on account of the
genuine exertions he was making to get well. April 7, he
returned to duty, smart and well set up.</p>

<p>Babinski and Froment always give the suspected subject
the benefit of the doubt, never uttering the word simulation

for psychotherapy will act to cure simulation or exaggeration
just as it acts to cure hysteria. They say that in their experience,
all these disorders of doubtful nature&mdash;that is, that

<p>A regular army man, 38, well built and muscular, in
Flanders the first winter, returned to England in January,
1915, with “trench foot.” “Neuritis” then developed, with
loss of power to walk. Baths, electricity, massage, sympathetic
wheeling about in a chair by women, all failed.</p>

<p>January 11, 1916, he still complained of inability to walk
or stand. The reflexes were exaggerated. He was able to
get into a wheel chair from bed by jerks, associated with
palpitation, tremors, flushing and sweating.</p>

<p>He was told that he had now recovered from the neuritis.
Crutches, sticks and wheelchair were removed. He flopped
about and then lay on the bed exhausted. In a few days he
began to shuffle about and was put on the stationary bicycle.
January 29, he left the hospital well, remarking that though
the treatment at first seemed cruel, it was fully justified.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> genuine polyneuritis, Mann gives German experience
regarding neuritis as somewhat frequent and affecting a
special form which he terms polyneuritis neurasthenica. He
states that the commonest instances of mononeuritis developing
in the war are the sciatic and trigeminal. The neuritis
often outlasts the other symptoms. The treatment was rest,
tepid baths, and electricity. Naturally, alcohol and syphilis
must be excluded in the diagnosis.</p>

<p>Nonne also described non-alcoholic, non-syphilitic, and
non-infectious polyneuritis in neurasthenics, which he, however,
finds most common in the ulnar, median, radial, anterior
crural and posterior tibial nerves.</p>

<h4><b>Case 513.</b> (<span class="smcap">Buzzard</span>, December, 1916.)</h4>

<p>Early in the war, a lad, 19, was blown up by a shell. He
was sent home paralyzed from waist down, and was seen by
Capt. Buzzard after he had spent ten months in various
hospitals, “carefully nursed, on the water bed, constantly
using a bed urinal, smoking innumerable cigarettes, and eating
countless chocolates.” He could not move his legs.
They were wasted and flaccid. The knee-jerks could be got
with difficulty. Plantar reflexes flexor. Complete anesthesia
from umbilicus downwards, but preservation of abdominal
reflexes. The navel did not shift downwards when the
patient attempted to sit up. The incontinence was not real;
urine was passed into the urinal at appropriate intervals.</p>

<p>Buzzard directed treatment “not to his spinal cord but to
his mind; isolation; the stoppage of tobacco and all visits;
the assurance that he would rapidly get well, together with
some suggestive faradization of his legs.” This brought
about a cure in a very short period. The atrophied legs
eventually grew strong enough to walk.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> cigarettes in Shell-shock, Mott decries the over-liberal
gifts of cigarettes that induced cigarette habits in both
officers and men. Of course, the cigarettes are still more
detrimental to cases of soldier’s heart than to other cases of

tea-parties, joy rides and drives given by well-meaning ladies
for the “poor dears,” actually perpetuating neuroses.</p>

</div>

<h4><b>Case 514.</b> (<span class="smcap">Hurst</span>, September, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A lance corporal, 26, became blind, deaf and dumb, though
without losing consciousness, when blown up by a shell,
August 29, 1916. His sight returned next day. On reaching
England he talked in his sleep. Encouragement, electricity,
etherization failed to effect improvement. One night in
November he woke up and asked the sister for a drink;
thereafter he talked normally.</p>

<p>Seven months after the shell explosion he was transferred
to the neurological section at Netley, March 21, 1917. Deaf
to air and bone conduction, a loud noise behind him caused
a slight tremor of hands, with blinking and dilatation of pupils;
but further stimuli of the same sort failed to produce such
reactions. Normal nystagmus and giddiness on functional
tests of vestibular nerve and canals. The internal ear was
then probably free from organic changes. Since shell-shock
mutism is always hysterical, it was probable that the deafness
was hysterical. Under hypnosis (staring at lines for
fifteen seconds) he showed no change. During natural
sleep, also, a shout of “Fire” and metallic noises failed to
wake the patient or to produce contraction of eyelids. Electric
suggestion (despite the patient’s belief in electricity) and
reëducation failed.</p>

<p>April 16, he was told that a small operation would have to
be done April 20. To this he readily consented. Two small
incisions were made behind the ear under light ether and
suture was inserted. A loud noise was made during the
“operation”; he heard this noise and jumped from the
table. To his intense delight normal hearing returned in
a few minutes. Next day hearing was tested and found
normal to air and bone conduction. He was discharged to
duty three weeks later and on his way to France, June 29,
demonstrated his normal hearing to the physicians.</p>

<h4><b>Case 515.</b> (<span class="smcap">O’Malley</span>, May, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A private, 20 years of age, lost speech and hearing after
the battle of Neuve Chapelle. Eight days later he came
under the care of the laryngologist in a very excited state,
pointing to lips and ears and carrying a note with information
concerning his deafmutism.</p>

<p>Dr. O’Malley wrote on a piece of paper that he would restore
the patient’s speech and hearing. Dr. O’Malley then
used the mirror until the point of retching, and wrote, “You
can speak now; count up to ten loudly.” He did.</p>

<p>Dr. O’Malley next used the cold water douche to the right
ear to the point of giddiness, then shouting through a speaking-tube
(see description below). The patient then found
he could hear and the tears streamed down his face. Thereafter
he was able to converse freely. Dr. O’Malley writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The treatment of functional deafness consists in exciting
the vestibular apparatus as follows. Cold or hot
water is allowed to flow in a steady stream into and out
of the external auditory meatus by means of a tube
attached to a receptacle placed about one and a half to
two feet above the patient’s head and continued until
he becomes very giddy and an active nystagmus is produced.
A speaking-tube three feet long is then used
by placing the ear-piece in the ear so treated, and the
surgeon shouts into the mouth-piece the assertion,
“You hear now,” and the answer, “Yes” comes
promptly. The tube is now dropped and a conversation
held as if no deafness ever existed. So far I have
found the treatment of one ear sufficient. The patient is
usually very emotional, as the disturbed vestibular function,
which in these cases responds easily and markedly,
causes him to feel as uncomfortable as a bad sailor on a
stormy voyage. This feeling, however, rapidly gives
way to one of pleasure at the return of his hearing.
Where functional deafness and mutism co-exist it does
not appear to be material which is treated first. In two
cases of this kind under my care I treated the loss of
voice first.</p>

<p>Bullet through mouth; Hysterical mutism. Treatment
by operative manipulation.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 516.</b> (<span class="smcap">Morestin</span>, January, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A Colonial infantryman, 32, was wounded December 17,
1914, at the Boisselle, being struck by a bullet which entered
on the right side in the upper part of the neck and came out
behind the left side of the mouth, having traversed the
tongue, broken two teeth, and caused a good deal of hemorrhage
by mouth. The patient felt his tongue swell, and
from this time on he could not pronounce a word. He was
sent to the ambulance, then to Mien, then to Saint Germain,
and finally to Morestin’s surgical service. With wounds by
this time healed, the patient found it hard to open his mouth.
There was no trace of fracture of the lower jaw. The tongue
could be only incompletely examined. The man swallowed
liquids easily but could take no solid food. He tried hard to
speak, made pantomime movements, grew emotional and
lachrymose.</p>

<p>On the whole, however, it seemed that his inability to
articulate sound could not be due directly to the lesion.
There must be either simulation or hysteria. For four days
he was attentively watched, and not once did he pronounce a
word. He grew more and more stricken and humiliated
by his plight. Rigorous diet did not cause his mutism to
cease. Isolation and ennui did not decide him to talk. Accordingly,
it was announced, in the man’s hearing, that an
operation was to be done to restore speech. January 9,
1915, his face was copiously washed with alcohol and ether.
Cocaine was injected to secure anesthesia and resolution of
the muscles of mastication. Six c.c. of a 1-100 solution on
each side. Shortly the surgeon began to open the jaws,
against decreasing resistance. The tongue, which was not
spastic, was seized with a tractor and rhythmic movements
were executed with it. After a few of these movements, joy
was painted on the features of the patient. He said that he
wanted to speak and that he was about to speak. He shook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_723" id="Page_723">[723]</a></span>
the surgeon’s hands effusively and said, “<i>Merci</i>.” Although
the first words came hard, little by little speech became free
and a perfectly sincere elation at having recovered speech
set in.</p>

<p>This man was neuropathic, having always been a rather
strange, irritable and restless person, and given to nervous
crises in anger, in which he lost consciousness entirely.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> pseudo operations as forms of disguised persuasion,
almost countless methods have been used. See Cases 514,

<p><i>Re</i> treatment of mutism, Chavigny remarks that the
principle of treatment for mutism is quite different from
the principles of treatment of paralysis. The reëducation
of mutism is psychic. Chavigny claims probably absolute
success in the treatment of mutism through faradism to the
larynx region simultaneously with a signal given to the
patient to make an effort to pronounce the letter A. Garel
modifies the treatment (in case the faradic apparatus is not
at hand), by a vigorous and sudden blow to the patient’s
epigastrium simultaneously with the patient’s endeavor to
imitate the movement of the doctor’s lips.</p>

<p>Aphonia: manipulation in larynx.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 518.</b> (<span class="smcap">O’Malley</span>, May, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A corporal, 28, had a bullet pass through his neck from a
point in the middle line at the upper border of the thyroid
cartilage to a point behind the right sternomastoid muscle,
two inches below the point of entry. The corporal lost his
voice at the time of injury, spat up a teaspoonful of blood,
and thereafter was able to whisper only. The laryngoscopic
examination betrayed no intralaryngeal lesion. Treatment
as described below enabled the patient to speak. O’Malley
describes his technique as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The patient is placed in the common position for the
examination of the larynx, the tip of the tongue being
seized in a piece of linen by the left hand fingers and the
laryngeal mirror introduced with the right hand. The
patient is then requested to say “e” or cough, and if
the cords do not approximate, they can be made to do
so by using moderate friction on the fauces and pharynx
with the mirror to excite secretion. The latter begins
to drop into the larynx, and acting as a foreign body, a
protective reflex is at once excited which adducts the
cords to prevent the secretion from entering the trachea.
At the same time an involuntary cough is produced
to expel the mucus, and if the friction and flow
of secretion are maintained and the patient is urged to
cough vigorously, voluntary coughing and a tendency
to retching with forced laryngeal notes will rapidly
follow. It is usually best to persist until retching
occurs, as the cords are then forced together to protect
the larynx and trachea from the possible entrance of
regurgitated stomach contents. Involuntary laryngeal
sounds are thus produced and the patient is conscious
of laryngeal effort. Some of these cases are at
the moment very shallow breathers, which can be demonstrated
by X-ray screening, but the act of retching
causes a wide excursion of the diaphragm with a more
pronounced expiratory blast, to be rapidly followed by
deeper inspirations. This method of treatment is best
carried out just before a meal, as the stomach is then
practically empty and the unpleasant effects of the
sudden regurgitation of food are avoided. When the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_726" id="Page_726">[726]</a></span>
explosive sounds accompanying retching have occurred
two or three times the mirror is withdrawn, the tongue
released, and the patient is requested to swallow, take
a deep breath, and cough, and then urged to count up to
ten, directing his voice to a certain point on the ceiling.
This method has given me uniformly good results, and
was rapidly effective in all cases coming under treatment
soon after the onset of the neurosis.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Re</i> methods for curing aphonia, Muck has a method called
the “ball” method. A ball is put into the larynx to cause a
temporary suffocation, which produces a reflex that starts
the adductors. He would apply the method as soon as the
man was well over the shock that produced aphonia. Muck
states that he has applied the ball method, not only to cases
of aphonia, but to cases of mutism and deafness, with success.</p>

<p>Tilly mentions a case in which the patient refused to open
his mouth, so the device was adopted of passing an electrode
through the left nostril so that it finally reached the larynx.
A spasm was produced, which was carried to the point of
considerable cyanosis, but the aphonia was relieved and for
the first time in three months the man spoke. Incidentally
he began to hear also.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> treatment of aphonia, Schultz has used the electric
current externally over the larynx, all the while carrying
on a laryngoscopy. Schultz remarks upon the fatigue that
may come during the first few sittings. Roussy and Lhermitte
remark that, although aphonia sometimes exists from
the outset of shock, it is often a phase in recovery from
mutism.</p>

<p>Liébault notes that, not only cases of true nervous aphonia
but cases of laryngitis, apparently of infectious origin, and
cases of true voice strain, may also turn up for treatment.
Some men have been improperly discharged from the army
for aphonia actually due to voice strain.</p>

<h4><b>Case 519.</b> (<span class="smcap">Vlasto</span>, January, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A mechanician was refitting an engine valve, when steam
was suddenly put on and the drains were opened out. Some
of the steam entered the throat of the mechanician, who
rushed up, gasping, unable to speak. Oedema of the larynx
was thought of; but there was no complaint except the inability
to speak.</p>

<p>A month later he was discharged to the hospital ship at
Plassy, where he got faradic treatment, the effect of which
was to cause him pain without recovery of voice. The man
could whisper well enough and cough fairly loudly. The
vocal cords of the larynx appeared normal on laryngoscopic
examination, but adduction of the cords was not be properly
effected. He was now given rest and constant assurances
that he would get well.</p>

<p>Ten days later, another laryngoscopic examination was
made, with mild mechanical stimulation of the air passage.
The patient remarked that he had never been so near being
able to speak since his dumbness came on. The patient
was now informed that his muscle of talking was going to be
replaced and that the success of the operation depended upon
his help, so that he was to shout out as soon as he became
conscious of the physician’s working inside his throat. The
patient was given ether lightly, into the second stage. When
consciousness was about to return, the laryngeal mirror was
placed lightly on the larynx. The patient was commanded
and encouraged to count out loud and shout. Speech returned
permanently.</p>

<p>It is to be noted that there was no specific war effect
underlying the phenomena, unless we regard the fact of its
being war time as contributory to the shock produced by an
incident in every day engine room duties.</p>

following night; the next morning, his voice was again lost.
The aphonia persisted for a fortnight, and the patient could
hear only loud shouting when close to his ear. He was
anxious to get well and requested electricity from the physician,
Dr. Smyly, having heard probably of another case
cured thereby. Dr. Smyly applied faradic current to the
larynx externally, instructing the patient to blow at the

not hear himself speak, but on suggestion succeeded in
speaking up loudly enough. He was shortly able to speak

<p>Shell-shock blindness: Cure by a course of injections

</div>

<h4><b>Case 521.</b> (<span class="smcap">Bruce</span>, May, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A soldier from Gallipoli was admitted to the Royal Victoria
Hospital at Edinburgh, blind. He had been at Gallipoli
from May 1, 1915, until August 12, when a shell explosion
blew in his trench and buried him. He was dug out
nervous and tremulous. Shortly afterwards there was the
bright flash of a second shell, and amnesia set in until he
found himself in hospital. He could not see at all with the
left eye and the sight of the other was poor. He arrived in
Scotland, October 9. He was nervous, excitable and now
somewhat depressed, complaining of blindness and pain in
the left eye, and headache. The left eyelid drooped. The
fundus was normal. He had not been given an anesthetic.</p>

<p>It was explained to him that the eye had not been injured;
that it had become weak from the explosion; that he would
be given a series of injections into the left temple of a strong
drug which would restore the sight of the eye.</p>

<p>Gradually increasing quantities of normal saline solution
were given every morning. After four days he said that the
treatment was doing him good. A week later he said that the
eye was much stronger. After the fifteenth injection he could
not sleep. The headache was worse, and there was “moving
about inside his head.” Early in the morning he went
to sleep after a period of restlessness. He awoke at eight
o’clock able to see perfectly, and was overjoyed at the result.
There was some blurring and four days later he said he was
becoming blind again. More normal saline was injected,
causing pain. After that there was no relapse, and the man
was sent back to his unit.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> Shell-shock blindness, Ormond and Hurst recommend

<p>Deafness, cured by suggestion in writing.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 522.</b> (<span class="smcap">Buscaino</span> and <span class="smcap">Coppola</span>, 1916.)</h4>

<p>L. G., 20 years old; fusileer. (Mother of neuropathic constitution.
Father died in 50th year of heart disease. One
brother had hemiparesis from infantile cerebropathia.) The
patient suffered from infantile otitis media bilateralis, which
was followed by abundant chronic otorrhea from his fifteenth
year. He relates that for a long time he was obliged
to wear a very large handkerchief on his shoulders to receive
the pus, which came from an ear. No sex disease. Nothing
of importance in the physical anamnesis.</p>

<p>Patient entered the army, Jan. 15, 1915. In May, he was
sent to the front (Basso Isonzo). Towards the end of July,
while he was in the trench, a grenade exploded a short distance
from him, causing slight abrasions at the nape of the
neck and in the fleshy part of the left calf. He was picked
up in an unconscious state, and taken to the hospital at
Cervignano, where he was admitted as a deafmute and was
given electric treatments. After 18 days or so, first stammering
and then pronouncing with difficulty a few words,
he finally regained his speech entirely. Deafness continued,
however.</p>

<p>Being transported to a special hospital in Florence, he
was in a state of psychic excitement for several days, showing
also visual hallucinations&mdash;saw “many soldiers,” saw “many
soldiers all about him.” He was treated with chloral and
bromide. The suspicions of several physicians were aroused
by the obstinate declaration by the patient that he was incurably
deaf.</p>

<p>On being admitted to the clinic on August 22, he showed
complete deafness in addition to a slight degree of stupor;
he remained impassive to the glance of his questioner without
showing signs of worry about his condition, nor did he make
any effort to make himself understood by making lip-movements
(which is in contrast to another patient affected by
organic deafness, who on the contrary made great efforts to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_731" id="Page_731">[731]</a></span>
understand anything said to him, clearly showing his great
grief over his incapacity).</p>

<p>He failed to respond to auditory stimuli either by air
or by bone conduction. It was possible from the beginning
to exclude suspicion of simulation; during the day,
indeed, it was not possible by any of the repeated attempts
to awaken surprise in the patient by means of an acoustic
stimulus. At night, while the patient slept, it was possible,
however, to awaken him by calling his name, or by making
a fairly loud sound; the patient would then open his eyes
but was quite unable to hear. Neither confusion nor hallucinations
were in evidence.</p>

<p>He was able to converse very well and spontaneously (he
remembers having lost consciousness at the explosion of the
grenade and not coming to until after his arrival at the hospital
at Cervignano); he read correctly both mentally and
aloud, and answered by signs the questions put to him in
writing. Being face to face with hysterical traumatic deafness,
notwithstanding no other hysterical phenomena were
noticed, a successful attempt was made with suggestive
therapy, the patient being emphatically assured (always in
writing) that the following Sunday his hearing would be restored
without doubt. The following Sunday, in fact, during
the visit of a lady (one of his friends), hearing in his left
ear was suddenly and almost completely restored to the
patient. He was in profound emotion on account of this,
and upon the appearance of the physician he had a hard
weeping spell. During the following day, he began slowly
to hear with the right ear.</p>

<p>During the latter part of his stay at the clinic, however
(until September 24, 1915), a slight hypo-acusia in the right
ear persisted, along with severe headaches and pains in the
left ear (which the patient compared to the suffering as a
child with otitis).</p>

<p>At the otoscopic examination by a specialist, only residuals
of the old catarrhal otitis with retraction of the tympanic
membrane were found.</p>

<p>Shell-shock story reproduced in hypnosis. Recovery.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 523.</b> (<span class="smcap">Myers</span>, January, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A private had been found wandering in a village, in shirt
and socks, unable to give name, regiment, or number. He
was admitted at a field ambulance, and seen by Major Myers
three days later. No Christian name seemed familiar to
him. The past was a blank. He was depressed. There was
numbness over the occiput. The legs, hands and tongue
were tremulous. The left arm and leg and the left side of the
face, chest and abdomen were hypalgesic. The knee-jerks
were exaggerated; pseudo-clonus of left knee and right ankle.
There had been a nightmare of bombs thrown into trenches&mdash;one
thrown by a German hit him in the neck and woke him
up in a cold sweat.</p>

<p>In hypnosis the dream was repeated, and points about his
previous life were dragged out piecemeal. Next, the names
of village and near-by town, and finally his own name, regiment
and number were elicited. After the bomb-throwing,
he said, “I must have gone off my head and run away. I
must have taken off my clothes in a field. I spent the first
night under a hedge. I spent the next two nights in a wood.
I ate nothing. The next night I was walking along a road
on the outskirts of a village and I was taken to a house by
two men.” On waking, he proved unable to remember these
things and was promptly rehypnotized, whereupon the
memories became clearer and more ample. More powerful
suggestion was given, and complete recovery of memory
followed the second period of hypnotism. The pupils became
larger. The despondency disappeared, together with
the occipital numbness and the left-sided hypalgesia. He was
transferred to a base hospital, and thence after three weeks
to a hospital in England, made an uninterrupted recovery,
and rejoined his regiment.</p>

<h4><b>Case 524.</b> (<span class="smcap">Myers</span>, January, 1916.)</h4>

<p>Private, 29, seen by Major Myers in a base hospital the
day after entrance, was in a stupor from which he had to be
repeatedly roused to answer questions. He could recall
neither name, regiment nor age, and was unable to write or
read except a few letters in very large type. Twice he said
the words <i>war</i> and <i>comrade</i>, and made a gesture as if following.
He agreed that a shell came and intimated that he had
pains in the forehead. He could not hold his hands out for
many seconds without dropping them. Knee-jerks brisk.</p>

<p>Four days later he was very little better, never having
spoken voluntarily, but replying <i>yes</i> to the utterance of his
name, and was able with great effort to write his name. He
still intimated his severe headache. The next day the names
of his two children were given. He could not read aloud the
figure 2 but held up two fingers. Next day, he gave syllable
by syllable his wife’s name from her photograph.</p>

<p>A week from admission he was hypnotized and persuaded
to talk about the events that preceded his disorder, breathing
excitedly, gesturing, and evidently visualizing the scenes. He
had been in the trenches, had been sent to draw water at a
camp, and had been knocked down when two or three shells
burst over him. He carried out post-hypnotic suggestions.</p>

<p>He was hypnotized again, two days later, and now described
how, after shelling, he had lain on the ground, dazed;
had risen, picked up the water bottle, returned to the trenches,
and then lost all sense and reason. He recalled how his mates
had told him he was silly, but had lost all intervening memories.
But the full details were elicited by persuasion. Next
day he complained that he still wrote with difficulty. Under
hypnosis, his speech and writing were restored to normal.
He was discharged two days later to an English hospital.</p>

<p>He was then passed for foreign service, being prevented
from active service in the field by occasional severe headaches.</p>

<p>Burial after explosion of a “coal box”: Automatism,
amnesia, deafmutism: Recovery by hypnosis.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 525.</b> (<span class="smcap">Myers</span>, September, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A sergeant, 18, with nineteen months service in the army,
11 months in France, was seen by Lt. Col. Myers at a clearing
station to which he had been transferred after three days
in another clearing station, with a note “Found in the streets
of B&mdash;&mdash;, asking his way to the fire trench; could not be
got to speak on admission nor since; seems deaf, but now
writes rationally.”</p>

<p>Mute and very deaf at the second C. C. S., he regained a
good deal of his hearing with encouraging talk and also became
able to cough and utter P, B, F and S, finally whispering
name, regimental number, and the like. At the same time
he could write fluently. After being buried he had lost
himself until he had asked his way of a military policeman
at the crossroads in B&mdash;&mdash;. There was amnesia again until
he had been 48 hours in the clearing station at B&mdash;&mdash;. The
throat hurt as if it were pulled down when he tried to speak,
and his head ached when he tried to remember. There was
much tremor, especially of right arm. In a quiet room adjoining,
the tremors increased and there was much agitation.
Lt. Col. Myers suggested cure and encouraged the man,
finally inducing a mild hypnotic state in which he spoke aloud,
at first hesitatingly, later fluently.</p>

<p>The man eventually remembered what had happened after
he had extricated himself. He had run, as he thought,
towards the fire trench, taken a wrong direction, and met a
Frenchman who gave him eggs and bread, allowed him to
sleep on a couch, put him on a cart and drove him to B&mdash;&mdash;.
He was then very giddy and asked his way of the policeman.
The shell by which he was “terribly shaken” was a “coal box.”
Posthypnotic suggestion that the headache would not recur
and that he would shake hands with the orderly was successful.
He now talked in a proper voice, at first hesitatingly.
He looked another man as his clay-colored face resumed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_735" id="Page_735">[735]</a></span>
normal aspect. After a good night’s sleep he was evacuated
to a base hospital, thence to an English hospital, whence he
wrote six days later in gratitude for the successful treatment,
stating that he was now nearly well and hoped to be fit for
light duty.</p>

<p>Six weeks later he wrote that he was still dizzy. He also
remembered certain further details of his experience; how he
had wandered into a listening sap in front of the Huns’
barbed wire and had had a tussle with three Huns, after which
he was buried during the heavy shelling.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>This case belongs in the group termed by Myers
“A Group,” namely, the physical group, in which the
patient has been lifted, buried or knocked over by a
shell or otherwise felt physical or chemical effects of an
explosion (in contrast with the B Group, or psychical
group, in which fear of the noise or emotional response
to the mutilation of companions is the exciting cause).
Predisposing affections occur as often in the physical
group as in the psychical group. The average age of
mutism cases seen by Lt. Col. Myers is twenty-five.
Mutism is rare among commissioned officers. Lt. Col.
Myers has heard of but one or two cases.</p>

<p>With respect to the technique of getting these men to
utter sounds, Lt. Col. Myers states that he first assures
the patient that he has already cured many cases of
loss of speech by the method about to be employed.
The patient is next asked to copy his teacher as the
sounds (not the vowels) B, D, finally V, S and K are
made. The patient is, as a rule, shortly induced to
make the necessary movements of lips, tongue or throat.
“You see you are beginning to talk. Now let me hear
you cough.” The patient coughs. “You see you are
able to make a noise. I want you next to cough out
an A (Continental pronunciation).” After a time the
patient adds this vowel to the cough. Other vowels
are now taught him. Eventually a consonant is prefixed
to the vowel instead of the cough. The patient is
now delighted with his progress and can shortly repeat
surname and regimental number.</p>

<p>Mutism: Recovery by hypnosis.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 526.</b> (<span class="smcap">Hurst</span>, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A transport driver, 31, was run over by a loaded wagon at
Gallipoli in May, 1915, and fractured his pelvis. He remained
perfectly conscious but unable to speak for three days.
At the beginning of August, when he was admitted to the
war hospital, he still spoke with great difficulty and with
contortions of his face. Even when he did not speak, he had
facial contortions and that mental condition characteristic of
tic, namely: although he was able to control the contortions
by will, he felt uncomfortable during the control and finally
gave way to the irresistible impulse.</p>

<p>Under hypnotism, it was suggested to him that he would
be able to speak without difficulty and would no longer have
the contractions of the face. When he came out of hypnosis
he was able to talk quite normally, sang next evening at a
concert, and a few days later he took part in a play. The
facial contortions persisted in hypnosis and even afterwards,
but vanished after a second hypnosis.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> hypnosis as treatment of mutism, Ballard remarks
that a genuine return of speech and a merely hypnotic
speech must be distinguished.</p>

<p>Nonne is the great exponent of the use of hypnotism in
treatment of the war hysterias. He got as good results
from high as from lower classes of men. He remarks that
the hypnosis does not protect against recurrence if the patient
again falls under the original conditions that brought about
the first attack. Hypnosis may be used also as a diagnostic
measure between functional and organic cases. Even tics
and tremors have been at times cured.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> employment of hypnotism, Hurst suggests that it may
well be used, not only in mutism, but in hysterical deafness,
blindness, and occasionally in psychasthenia. It is not a
cure-all for the war hysterias, but is to be used as a not infrequent
form of treatment. Nonne claims cures of 51 out
of 63 cases of hysteria major (28 rapidly, 23 more gradually).
Ten of his 63 proved refractory to hypnosis altogether.</p>

<h4><b>Case 527.</b> (<span class="smcap">Hurst</span>, 1917.)</h4>

<p>An Australian, 22, wrote the following, August 21, 1916:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“You may be a little surprised to hear that I am in
the Hos. suffering from shell-shock, which has taken
away my speech and hearing. It is some sixteen days
now since it happened.… We were in the trenches
and going for dear life, when two of us spotted a German
machine gunner in a hole, so we made up our
minds to have him. We made a charge at him, and I
just remember getting to him when a high-explosive
shell burst at my head; it seemed as if it burst inside
my head; everything went black. I tried to call out
and couldn’t, and I could not hear my mates&mdash;only
just a terrible bursting in my head all the time. I
never remembered anything more until I came to on the
boat. The Drs. have told me that I will get alright in
time. I saw a good deal of France.… There is not
a young man there who is not in the Army. The girls
and women work in the fie&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

</div>

<p>The abrupt ending of the letter was due to the entrance of
Major Hurst. The patient had been hypnotized but his
deafness had persisted during the hypnotic sleep, so that suggestions
could not be effectively taken. He heard nothing
whatever during a very heavy thunderstorm, was unable to
make any sign whatever, and could not even cough.</p>

<p>He was now told in writing that his speech and hearing
would be restored when ether was given. After a few whiffs,
he struggled and before he was under began to repeat the
word “Mother.” Etherization was discontinued before his
limbs had even become relaxed. As he was coming to, he
was requested to repeat various words, and when the anesthetic
had passed, he was talking normally and had completely
recovered hearing.</p>

<p>Now, however, his memory had become a complete blank.
From a short time before his shell-shock up to the moment of
his regaining consciousness after etherization, he remembered
nothing of his loss of speech or hearing, nothing about the
events in his letter, and nothing about Major Hurst, whom he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_738" id="Page_738">[738]</a></span>
felt he had not previously seen. According to Hurst, this
patient had become (<i>a</i>) speechless from fright at the time of
the shell explosion, (<i>b</i>) deaf from the noise of the explosion,
and (<i>c</i>) unconscious from the windage. After he came to at
the time of the explosion, an autosuggestion to the effect
that he had lost his power of speech and hearing occurred.
Ether broke down this inhibition of speech and hearing by
interfering with the control of the high over lower cerebral
centers.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> emotional stammering, Chavigny treats by voice gymnastics,
rhythmical breathing movements, sounds spoken by
metronome with simultaneous movements of arms or trunk,
and by singing. <i>Re</i> hysterical stuttering, Roussy and Lhermitte
remark that the symptoms are always very pronounced,
come on suddenly, and cease just as suddenly under
the influence of electrical treatment. The history will differentiate
hysterical stuttering. The effects of treatment
will also help. Genuine non-hysterical stammering may, of
course, be increased through emotion or shock. Dundas
Grant aids the stutterer by having him twist a button or
carry out some other muscular movement simultaneously
with the attempt to speak. He also has the patient endeavor
to expand the lower part of his chest during the effort.</p>

<p>MacMahon notes that Shell-shock stammering is chiefly
a difficulty with vowel sounds and voiced consonants, and
amounts to a speech inhibition, accompanied sometimes by
amnesia for words and suggesting a form of aphasia. Mild
cases of such stammering are cured simultaneously. MacMahon
relies in part upon especially regulated breathing
movements and the attendant sense of repose. The cases of
old cured stammering that have come back under Shell-shock
are harder to treat.</p>

three days after the first burial, and neither he nor his comrade
were able to find their regiment.</p>

<p>Understanding was slow and look vacant. There were
jerky movements of the arms and a snoring sound from the
nasopharynx. Voluntary movements were restricted, weak,
slowly executed, jerky, and incoördinated, but not tremulous.

<p>In the next two days, the patient became brighter and
movements became better. On the seventh day stupor and
ataxia had disappeared. Familiar names could be repeated
and the next day could be given on request. The patient
would sweat profusely in giving replies. There was no spontaneous
speech. A week later speech had improved.</p>

became emotional upon being questioned as to trench life,
waking up suddenly from hypnosis and wiping the sweat
from his chest.</p>

<p>The next day, forgotten events of the second burial were
recalled together with what followed. Post-hypnotic suggestion
of the performance of eccentric actions was successful.</p>

the events of those two days were recalled. He was

<p><i>Re</i> hypnosis for “war shock,” Eder remarks that the usual
objections to hypnosis cannot apply because the majority of
cases have no neuropathic antecedents. Eder, as psychoanalyst,
endeavors to level hypnotic suggestion against the
so-called “complexes.” Elliot Smith and Pear commend
Lt.-Col. Myers’ results, but regard the results of hypnotic
treatment as brilliant but erratic. Colin Russel, regarding
hypnotism as an induced hysteria, remarks that a true
hysteria can hardly be cured by adding more, although he
has sometimes used the treatment with apparent success.
Podiapolsky notes that some 17 per cent of his functional
cases will, at a word, drop off into an artificial deep slumber.
He thinks chloroform should not be given to these subjects
without an attempt to secure this artificial deep slumber
first. Chavigny, highly commending suggestion, notes that
the use of hypnotism is prohibited in military hospitals in
France. A remark of Smirnow indicates that the Russian
authorities also look with disfavor upon hypnosis, but he
notes certain patients whom he cured by hypnosis, so that
apparently Russia did not absolutely forbid the use of hypnosis
in war cases. Another Russian, Arinstein, prefers the
Dubois method to hypnosis.</p>

<p>Roussy and Lhermitte definitely state that the psychotherapy
of Dejerine, Dubois, and Babinski beneficially replaces
hypnotic suggestion, “which ought definitely to be
rejected.” However, if the conclusions of Bernheim are
sound, there can be no theoretical claim of distinction between
hypnosis and other forms of suggestion.</p>

<p>Fifteen bayonet wounds; recommendation for Victoria
Cross: Hysterical contracture of hand, revealed
by hypnosis as the bayonet clutch.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 529.</b> (<span class="smcap">Eder</span>, August, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A left-handed Irishman, 23, on December 22, 1915, got
15 bayonet wounds, 14 of which were on the right side of the
body. He was in the trenches with 23 men, when they were
attacked by about 200 Turks. He and a sergeant leaped out
of the trench into a bayonet attack with Turks.</p>

<p>He was admitted to the hospital January 26, 1916, for a
hysterical contracture of the right hand. The fingers were
semi-flexed and could not be passively extended. Col. Purves
Stewart noted that there was an anesthesia and analgesia to
pin-pricks and cotton wool on the whole of the right arm.
“At the beginning of the examination, the patient felt pin-pricks
at the wrist; as examination continued, the boundary
of anesthesia steadily increased until it reached the shoulder,
by which time the previously sensitive spots were now anesthetic.”
Later there was a complete right hemianesthesia.</p>

<p>In telling his story, this soldier repeatedly emphasized that
“You must clutch your rifle very firmly and never let it up,
guarding yourself all the time.” This was the explanation
of the contracture. According to Eder, in the unconscious,
he was still clutching the rifle, fighting the good fight, and
symbolizing the desire by the grasping hand. In hypnosis,
suggestion was made that the fight was over and the rifle
could be let go, whereupon the hand was immediately relaxed.</p>

<p>The analgesia, thinks Eder, was present during the fight
and passed away subsequently. In fact, the soldier said that
he felt no pain during the fight and did not know that he was
wounded until his attention was called to the fact that blood
was flowing from him. According to Eder, the unconscious
mind refused to feel pain. At Col. Stewart’s first prick or
two “the unconscious took no notice, but as the pricks continued,
the former memory was revived and the unconscious
became on guard.” He had been recommended for the V. C.</p>

<p>Gunshot of forearm: Hysterical contracture, wrist
and fingers: Cure by hypnosis, “indecently quick.”</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 530.</b> (<span class="smcap">Nonne</span>, December, 1915.)</h4>

<p>An infantryman, without special hereditary taint and previously
well, was shot September, 1914, in the right forearm.
A paralysis of the hand and fingers persisted after the wound
had healed. Several reserve hospitals failed to cure the
paralysis.</p>

<p>Eight months after the injury he arrived at Nonne’s clinic
at Eppendorf, with a flexor contracture of the right wrist
joint as well as of the fingers (exclusive of thumb). The
finger tips were deeply sunk in the flesh of the palm. Extension
could only be brought about against strong resistance.
There was a total anesthesia for all sensations in the hand and
fingers. No contraction of visual fields.</p>

<p>The patient, upon suggestion, fell immediately into hypnosis.
At first the contracture was released with some difficulty;
then, with greater ease, and then without any
resistance whatever. During the same hypnotic séance the
patient finally became able to extend actively both fingers
and wrist; and next day, after the patient had convinced
himself of his cure, he was able voluntarily to stretch the hand
and fingers with normal amplitude and power. The disturbance
of sensibility had spontaneously disappeared.</p>

<p>This cure was, from the patient’s point of view, indecently
quick. He said everybody must feel he was a malingerer, and
in fact he felt so himself. He went back into service, where
he had been for several months at the date of Nonne’s report.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> Nonne’s enthusiasm for hypnosis, see under <a href="#case526">Case 526</a>.
Nonne, contrary to Babinski and Froment, would regard
even the severe and obstinate vasomotor disturbances as
purely functional and as not even “sub-organic.” The basis
of this belief is that hypnosis cures these phenomena as well
as various tics and pertinacious tremors. French observers
consider that these tics and tremors may even be organic
in their nature, basing their ideas upon the non-success of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_743" id="Page_743">[743]</a></span>
suggestion. (It may be noted [see under <a href="#case528">Case 528</a>] that
the French military authorities do not allow the use of
hypnotism in the army.) With respect to the present case
(<a href="#case530">530</a>), of course, the French observers would not deny the
power of hypnotism to produce the cure. Babinski and
Froment’s Postscript to the English edition of their work on
hysteria, remarks that, though Roussy and Lhermitte state
that vasomotor symptoms may disappear along with the
psychotherapeutic cure of paralyses and contractures, yet
Roussy and Boisseau later admitted that improvement in
thermal and vasomotor control is at best an exceedingly
slow one.</p>

<p>More recent personal communications indicate that there
is still room for some question as to the curability by suggestion
of such disorders as tic, tremor, vasomotor imbalance,
and the like. In short, the true scope of the “pithiatic”
or suggestion-curable diseases is still somewhat a matter of
controversy.</p>

<p>Shell-shock: “Doll’s head” anesthesia, mutism:
Hypnosis.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 531.</b> (<span class="smcap">Nonne</span>, December, 1915.)</h4>

<p>An officer, mute for five months following shell-shock, had
been for four months treated in a succession of hospitals&mdash;field
hospital, war hospital, two reserve hospitals.</p>

<p>He had no acquired or hereditary neuropathic taint, but
even in the period before the critical shock he had been under
tremendous physical and mental strain. The explosion
produced a total anesthesia of the skin of the head, face,
neck and shoulder region&mdash;in short, what Charcot called
the “doll’s head” form of sensory disorder. Moreover,
there was a marked contraction of the visual fields.</p>

<p>The patient, when treatment was given, fell at once into a
deep hypnosis and began to intone, and then to speak isolated
words, and finally to speak complete sentences. All
that was left of his mutism was a slight over-fatiguability of
the speech organs. This also cleared up in the next few days.
He was discharged well, and had already been&mdash;December,
1915&mdash;some months in the field.</p>

<p><a href="#case531">Case 531</a>, though an officer, responded to hypnosis well,
and Nonne remarks that hypnotizability is independent of
the presence of any neuropathic tendencies, or of any loss
of resistance through exhaustion. One trouble with the hypnotic
method, according to Nonne, is the fatigue of the
hypnotizer and his inability to rely upon assistants.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> Charcot, Nonne remarks that the work of Charcot on
hysteria is not sufficiently well-known, especially as civilian
practitioners in peace times had few cases. <i>Re</i> taint, Nonne
found such tendencies absent in more than half of his cases
with careful anamneses. The absence of adequate psychogenic
cause is a not uncommon experience according to
Nonne. Nonne, finding 26 cases of pure neurosis amongst
1800 cases of war injury, had a considerable number of odd
erroneous diagnoses in the group. Not only were cerebrospinal
paralyses wrongly diagnosticated, but ischemic paralysis,
plexus paralysis, arthritis deformans and synovitis.</p>

<p>A soldier is put in the Landsturm at 22 and later
called “unfit” by reason of tremors after mine-explosion
(history of tremors at 14 after a fall), but
is cured by hypnosis.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 532.</b> (<span class="smcap">Grünbaum</span>, November, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A <i>Landsturm</i> soldier, 22 (father excitable, family otherwise
normal), had a history of being the best scholar in the
class and well up to his fourteenth year. At 16 he fell from
a tree and though he apparently sustained no injury his head
and arm began to tremble. He became unable to learn and
gave up his preparations to be a teacher. The tremor,
however, disappeared in six months and he went into some
technical work. At 16½ years he went as cabin-boy, but in
a fortnight he was sent home by the physician. He then
began to breed carrier pigeons and got first prizes at international
exhibitions. He also went into foundry work and
did well as an apprentice. He worked well at home and
busied himself with setting up small electrical and other machines.
He had never been interested in women and loved
his pigeons best, and therefore was regarded by people who
knew him as not quite right. He was also non-alcoholic.</p>

<p>After mobilization he was sent back twice but finally was
put into a <i>Jäger</i> Battalion. After reaching the front he had
to have a hernia operation and on getting well went back to
his place and a few days later a mine exploded near him. He
was much frightened and fell down unconscious. On regaining
consciousness he felt a “running” in the legs and
tremors in the hands. The latter grew stronger and began
to affect the arms.</p>

<p>After two months in hospital he went to garrison unrecovered,
was placed in the <i>Landsturm</i> and did four months
station duty in Russia. The tremors persisted and when his
comrades played a bad practical joke on him the tremors got
so bad that he was sent back home as unfit for service.</p>

<p>He was a stocky looking, well-nourished man of middle
height, without visceral disease or sign of organic nervous disorder.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_746" id="Page_746">[746]</a></span>
The shaking tremor grew much more powerful in
any state of excitement but always paused sufficiently to
permit the execution of any particular movement. The head
movements were continuous, slight rotations. There were a
few regions of anesthesia to touch, but these areas differed at
different examinations. There was a general hyperesthesia.
Conjunctival, corneal and pharyngeal reflexes were absent.
The man was slightly excitable, apprehensive, depressed,
complained of sleeping badly, did not want to sit or stand and
felt as if he wanted to run away, no matter where. In dropping
off to sleep he would fall out of bed and talked aloud in
his sleep. He thought he was incurably sick. Intelligence
and school knowledge were very good.</p>

<p>He was hypnotized eight times for periods of about five
minutes each. Hypnosis was extremely easy to accomplish.
At the second trial the manual tremor disappeared. After
the third trial there was an essential improvement in the
shaking tremor. Moreover, his emotional state had become
happier. He began to sleep well. He was now free from
disease and regained confidence and looked upon himself
as well and fit for work. Undoubtedly without hypnotism
this man would have been released from service after a few
months of inconsequential hospital care without pension.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> tremors, see remarks under <a href="#case308">Case 308</a>, concerning the
possibly organic nature of many of the so-called Shell-shock
tremors; an opinion apparently shared in by Meige and by
Guillain. Babinski also found that these tremors were not
influencible by psychotherapy. Yet here is an instance in
which tremors are reported cured by hypnosis, and moreover,
tremors that were recurrent from an ante-bellum attack
at 14. See remarks under <a href="#case530">Case 530</a>.</p>

Recovery under hypnosis, two séances.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 533.</b> (<span class="smcap">Nonne</span>, December, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A musketeer, without neuropathic taint and without nervous
symptoms before the war (parents both dead of tuberculosis,
eleven brothers and sisters died young), saw four
comrades killed by a shell October 27, 1914. The musketeer
himself was slightly injured superficially in the back. He
remained unconscious for three hours and on coming out
showed general tremor of the body, felt pressure in the head,
was lachrymose and unable to walk or stand. He was subject
to insomnia. He was in four different hospitals, finally
reaching Eppendorf. Diagnosis rendered at the first hospital
and carried on through the others was hemorrhage into the
spinal canal.</p>

<p>For two months at Eppendorf he lay in extension. He
was then examined by Nonne, who found general neuropathic
habitus, pronounced “cramp neurosis” in the lower
extremities, psychogenic astasia-abasia, hyperidrosis of the
lower extremities, marked cyanosis of feet and lower legs,
increased tendon and skin reflexes, pseudoclonus, no Babinski
or Oppenheim reflexes. The man complained of pressure
in the head, sleeplessness, a feeling of depression and hopelessness.
Pulse 120-130.</p>

<p>Hypnosis proved easy. After the first treatment the man
stood and walked and showed no tremor. The next day the
hypnosis was repeated and the cyanosis of the legs disappeared.
Sleep on the second night was good. Appetite
returned and the man fell into a good emotional state.
Thereafter the patient was intentionally ignored by the
physicians and could soon not be distinguished in any respect
from the other non-nervous convalescents.</p>

<p>This case is expressly stated by Nonne to resemble in all
respects those formerly described by Oppenheim as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_748" id="Page_748">[748]</a></span> “traumatic
neurosis.”</p>

<p>Crural monoplegia: Cured by hypnosis.</p>

<h4><b>Case 534.</b> (<span class="smcap">Hurst</span>, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A Belgian soldier fell into mud on the collapse of a roof
from which he was observing the enemy. It was an hour
before he got his left leg out of the mud, and found it fixed
in extension. He was sent to England, where for three
months the leg remained stiff. The spastic paralysis did not
seem organic as the leg was dragged behind. The knee and
ankle could be bent only by using much force. The entire
leg was in all ways anesthetic. Babinski sign gave additional
proof that the condition was hysterical: when the patient lay
with arms folded and legs apart and then tried to sit up, the
normal leg was lifted and the paralyzed leg remained flat.</p>

<p>According to Hurst, the paralysis and stiffness were due
to an autosuggestion from the legs being embedded in mud.
The anesthesia was probably a matter of medical suggestion
produced in the course of examination during the three
months of disability. According to Hurst, Babinski is right
in supposing that hysterical anesthesia is almost invariably
produced by the observer.</p>

<p>Accordingly a strong faradic current was passed through
the leg, and he was assured that sensation and power would
be restored. However, he could still walk only with difficulty.</p>

<p>Hypnosis was therefore resorted to and repeated on several
occasions. He went back to duty in three weeks, although he
still held the leg somewhat stiff when he walked.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> recurrences after hypnotism, see remarks of Nonne
under <a href="#case530">Case 530</a>. Howland also notes that cases treated by
hypnotism must be followed up to prevent relapse. In the

<h4><b>Case 535.</b> (<span class="smcap">Nonne</span>, December, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A reservist, always well, not neuropathic (mother had had
seizures, possibly epileptic, for many years) was wounded in
the left calf by a shell fragment, about the middle of December,
1914. He was at the same time, as a result of the shell
explosions near by, afflicted with a tremor of the whole body;
this tremor gradually increased and proved refractory to all
treatment for nine months.</p>

<p>At the beginning of September, 1915, the patient reached
Nonne’s wards, showing tremor of head, arms and legs,
with pronounced hypalgesia of the whole body, abolition of
frontal and conjunctival reflexes, and contraction of the
visual fields.</p>

<p>The tremor of the head was completely removed at the
first hypnotic treatment. There was a slight recurrence of
this tremor two days later, and traces of it could be observed
for nine days. A third hypnotic treatment swept away this
tremor, which did not return.</p>

<p>The patient was discharged after about four weeks, suitable
for garrison duty.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> traumatic neurosis, Nonne dislikes this term of Oppenheim,
because such a term rather tends to connote unfavorable
prognosis. As quoted under <a href="#case530">Case 530</a>, Nonne holds
that the war data show that hysteria is neither a form of
degeneration nor an affair built on the Freudian schema.</p>

<p>Nonne in fact maintains that the hysterical syndrome may
occasionally occur with much greater ease in a normal person
than ever has been known before. It is precisely in these
cases of normals getting hysterical that Nonne gets especially
good results with hypnosis. If the development of
the hysterical syndrome had extended over days or weeks,
then the hypnotic cure was a slower one. The above reservist
developed his Shell-shock gradually and required three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_750" id="Page_750">[750]</a></span>
hypnotic treatments. But although the number of doses of
hypnotism required may be said roughly to depend upon
the time which the condition took to come to a head, yet
there is no similar rule <i>re</i> duration. A miracle cure may be
brought about even in cases that have lasted over a year.
This result, if confirmed, would signify that the hysterical
condition once fixated did not especially increase in its
tenacity.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> hypnosis in Germany, it should be noted that Nonne
is the chief protagonist for hypnosis, at least among the
well-known neurologists. Psychoelectric cures, which the
Germans term Kaufmann’s cure, are also greatly in vogue in
German clinics. Despite the well-based claims of Lt.-Col.
Myers and of Eder, some English observers appear to condemn
hypnosis as inadequate, or even as dangerous.</p>

might yield a wrong impression of the value of hypnosis
(see Feiling’s unsuccessful <a href="#case369">case 369</a>).</p>

<h4><b>Case 536.</b> (<span class="smcap">Nonne</span>, December, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A volunteer, of nervous parents, had for four years suffered
from attacks of uncertain (hysterical or epileptic) nature.
These attacks came on again after strenuous marching
in the campaign in Belgium and France. Released from
service at the front and detailed for guide duty, he proved
unsuitable for this work, too, and was sent back to a hospital
at home. Here there gradually developed a paralysis of the
lower extremities. Treatment proved ineffective.</p>

<p>At the end of January, 1915, he came to Nonne’s wards
at Eppendorf with a paralysis that had lasted six months.
There was a total paraplegia inferior, with anesthesia for all
sensation from the knees downward. The lower legs and
feet were cyanotic and cold. The tendon and skin reflexes
were lively. There was a moderate contraction of the visual
fields on both sides.</p>

<p>Under hypnosis, the patient proved able to move both
joints somewhat, but very weakly and slowly. The patient
was hypnotized daily for a week, and made slow progress.
Only after another week did it prove possible to get him to
stand. After four weeks, his gait had so improved as to look
like that of a tired old man. Three weeks more of treatment
permitted the patient to walk, run and hop normally.
Repeated <i>waking</i> suggestion had failed to accomplish anything
in this case. The improvement followed only hypnosis. It
seems to be a general principle that in cases of gradual development,
the recovery by hypnosis will also be gradual.</p>

eye, owing to hypermetropia and amblyopia. He was hit on
the left side of the head by a rifle butt, and knocked unconscious,

all with his left eye, which he had never been in the habit of
using. August 10, he was wounded slightly in the left thigh.
August 23, while still on duty, with the wound not completely
healed, he was blown up by a shell. He regained
consciousness on a stretcher. Feeling the pain in his old
wound, he thought he should be unable to walk.</p>

<p>On shipboard, he found that he actually could not walk.
He kept his left eye covered by a shade on account of headache
that would follow exposure to light. He was much
excited and had bad nightmares.</p>

<p>After the journey home from the Dardanelles, it was found
that the left eye was normal except for the hypermetropia,
despite the fact that he was quite unable to see with the eye.</p>

<p>He was hypnotized four times, losing the nightmares and
much of the headache after the first treatment; the eye pain
on exposure to light, after the second treatment; and the
blindness, after the third treatment. He was now able to
see with his left eye as well as before he was struck. He was
still unable to walk without crutches. Hypnotized the fourth

<p>An English private, 22, was looking over a parapet, July
18, 1915. He afterward remembered sand thrown in his
eyes and a fall backward, hitting his head, after a shell had
struck the sandbags in front of him. He was unconscious
24 hours. Upon recovery, he found himself completely blind,
save that he could just tell light from darkness with the left
eye. His eyes were sore and eyelids blackened; there was
also severe headache and partial deafness.</p>

<p>Hearing returned and the headache improved shortly; but
the condition of the eye seemed more permanent. On
forcibly opening the eyes, September 14, they were turned
far upwards so that the iris could scarcely be seen. Some
sand grains were buried in the conjunctiva, not in the cornea.
There was no inflammation about the sand grains.</p>

<p>In hypnosis, he was told that he would see on waking.
The moment he woke, this suggestion was repeated forcibly
and his eyes were held open. He cried out that he could see;
tears ran down his cheeks; he fell on his knees in gratitude.
Three days later, he said he was able to see as well as he had
ever seen. There was, however, an opacity of the vitreous
of the left eye, the result of a retinal hemorrhage: doubtless
the result of injury at the time of the explosion. September
30, he had perfect vision in the right eye and 6/36 in his left.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> results of hypnotic treatment, Lt.-Col. Myers, summarizing
23 cases of Shell-shock, got apparently complete
cures in 26 per cent, and distinct improvement in another

<p>Appendix operation: Post-operative retention of
urine. Relief by hypnosis.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 539.</b> (<span class="smcap">Podiapolsky</span>, August, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A soldier, 32, operated for appendicitis, had a post-operative
retention of urine. Hypnotic suggestion was requested
to reëstablish excretion of urine before resort should be had
to the catheter.</p>

<p>Somnambulistic amnesia was obtained at once and without
questioning him P. suggested to him directly that he
must feel the need of micturition. The suggestion was unsuccessful.
However, bearing in mind psychogenic obstacles
of an unknown nature, P. questioned the patient as to sensations
and learned that in the operation the skin had been
burned about the urinary passage and that the patient
feared micturition. Besides this, micturition was painful on
account of the wound above the appendix. The patient also
feared that the sutures would yield.</p>

<p>Accordingly assurance was given that the burned parts
would be insensible and that the bladder could be emptied
without effort and without endangering the sutures. Analgesia
was produced by a few passages of the hand upon the
bed clothes. Complying with post-hypnotic suggestion the
patient urinated after a quarter of an hour of sleep, and in
thirty-six hours retention was relieved.</p>

<p>With respect to frequency of immediate somnambulism for
the first trial, P. states that, although authorities set the
percentage of successful immediate somnambulisms at 17-20
per cent, war conditions yield three or four times as high a
percentage. The war has produced a suitable soil for hypnotism.
Hypnosis is impossible in from 1½ to 2 per cent of
cases.</p>

<p>Wound of sciatic nerve: Pains after operation.
Relief by hypnosis.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 540.</b> (<span class="smcap">Podiapolsky</span>, August, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A German prisoner, 33, was admitted to a Russian Hospital,
November 11, 1916, with “a bad wound of upper right
thigh, marked pains in right sciatic nerve especially affecting
feet.” Morphine and pantopon did not abolish the pain.
Insomnia. November 13, the sciatic nerve was surgically
freed from a scar and laid in the midst of the femoral biceps.
Every evening pantopon was injected; but the pains and
insomnia persisted nevertheless.</p>

<p>November 19, he was hypnotized. The pain stopped.
He had an excellent night, and the next day felt only a slight
pain in the toes.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, while giving him suggestion in the German
language, P. had said fingers instead of toes (inadvertently,
since the Russian language uses the same term for
both). He slept well to November 29 but still felt a slight
pain in the toes. On November 29 another hypnotic sitting
was given, and the toes this time were named correctly.
The next day the patient said, “You have relieved me of all
the rest of my pain.” He had no pain thereafter and the
morphine and pantopon were dispensed with. Sleep returned.</p>

<p>Incidentally, this patient had his hair grow white in a few
months of war.</p>

<h4><b>Case 541.</b> (<span class="smcap">Riggall</span>, April, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A survivor of H.M.S. T.B. II, blown up by a mine off
Harwich, was admitted to the naval hospital at Chatham,
March 3, 1916, a well-nourished, nervous looking lad, aged
20. After the accident, he began to dream, always the same
dream, of the explosion, waking up with the cry of the ship
mates, and then unable to sleep the rest of the night. The
knee and ankle-jerks were somewhat exaggerated.</p>

<p>April 15, when there had been no improvement, he was
hypnotized. The patient was told to lie back in an arm
chair, make himself comfortable and allow muscles to relax.
He was told to fix his eyes and concentrate his attention on
an electric lamp. The suggestion of sleep was made, and he
was repeatedly told in a monotonous voice that he was becoming
more and more sleepy. Then in an emphatic voice
he was told that the treatment would completely cure him.
He had no more dreams after this first sitting.</p>

<p>Hypnosis was continued every other day until April 20,
when he was discharged cured. After the first sitting hypnosis
was induced by simply telling the patient to go to sleep,
which he would immediately do on entering the room, while
still standing up. At subsequent sittings, he was made to
write twenty times such phrases as: “I feel much better”;
“I shall have no more bad dreams.”</p>

<p>Once when a tooth was to be pulled a post-hypnotic suggestion
that no more pain would be felt was given, nor was any
pain felt. Headache persisted after the first two or three
sittings. Accordingly, during hypnosis a pencil was pressed
to the forehead with the suggestion that it would burn and
that after waking there would be an itching pain for half
an hour, followed by recovery from headache. Curiously
enough, a distinct erythema of the skin was observed over
the point of pressure. Toothache and headache vanished.</p>

<h4><b>Case 542.</b> (<span class="smcap">Burmiston</span>, January, 1917.)</h4>

<p>May 22, 1916, a stoker, 26, was found on shipboard in a
workshop behind oil drums, refusing to come out, looking
dazed, not recognizing messmates, suspicious and complaining
of headache. He reached the Royal Naval Hospital at
St. Malo, May 24, answering questions “Don’t know,” and
physically normal except for diminished knee-jerks. At the
end of two or three weeks he would answer questions about
his stay at the hospital, but complained of headache or
weight in the head. Wassermann reaction, negative.</p>

<p>Special examination on May 26, showed an amnesia for
everything up to his arrival at St. Malo. For example, he
did not know the name or use of a hammer or a pressure
gauge, though he knew the pressure gauge was made of brass
and glass, having seen brass and glass in the hospital wards.
He had no idea of the nature of a ship. He was sent to the
sick bay at the Royal Naval Barracks at Chatham, July 7,
carrying a recommendation that he be retrained as a stoker.</p>

<p>He was put under hypnosis, induced by gazing at the brass
knob of a paper weight. He went off easily, was told there
was nothing to worry about, taken back to the beginning
of his illness, and asked what happened. He told about
a bomb explosion from aircraft, and how he had lost his
memory after a nearby explosion. He told how he was
married and had a child 21 months old. During the narrative
about bombs falling, his worry was such that he was
put in a deeper hypnotic sleep, and was told that he would
remember all that had happened. Upon being ordered to
wake up, he remained dazed for a few moments, and then
said that he was all right. Asked about his marriage, he
replied that of course he was married and had a child.</p>

<p>After four days leave, he returned, July 13, without trouble
except a headache, from which it appeared that he had suffered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_758" id="Page_758">[758]</a></span>
ever since a fall when a child. He was again put into
a hypnotic state and asked to remember the accident that
caused the headache. He was conducted back through the
years, and finally described a white house in India, his fall in
the area, the black people in white clothes, the cut bleeding
head. He was told that he would have no more of such
headaches. On being wakened, he said that his headache
was gone, and retold the story of the accident. August 2,
he said he had never felt better in his life. September 1, he
was drafted to a seagoing ship.</p>

<p>A private, 24, was admitted to hospital with diagnosis
neurasthenia, March 11, 1916. He suffered from vertical
headache; general analgesia, more definite on the right side
(patient left-handed); loss of smell and taste, also more
definite on the right side; paresis of right leg, with dragging of
foot (old trench foot); and sleeplessness.</p>

<p>The next day Tombleson put him in a hypnotic state, third
stage, and again, March 13, but without results.</p>

<p>March 14, the somnambulistic stage was reached in hypnosis,
and next day the man’s headache was much relieved as
a result of the suggestion offered. He was again hypnotized
and the following day, March 16, the headache had vanished
and the man was in general much improved. In somnambulism
the disappearance of the analgesia was suggested, and it
proved possible to make the man walk about without limp
and without dragging the right foot. Next day the analgesia
was much relieved. In somnambulism the suggestions
were repeated.</p>

<p>March 18, the man said he was quite well, and proved to be
so on examination, except that he could not yet taste with
absolute normality on the right side. In somnambulism it
was further suggested that the cure was a perfect one and
included the sense of taste. However, March 25, the expected
improvement had not yet occurred in the taste,
whereupon further suggestions were given in hypnotic somnambulism,
<i>re</i> taste. Next day taste had become normal.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> hypnosis, Tombleson says that the most successful
cases of hypnosis are those of Shell-shock psychasthenia, but
that he gets very good results with hyperthyroidism and
with neurasthenia also. He goes so far as to say that practically
all cases of war neurasthenia and psychasthenia can
be cured and sent back to work if treatment by hypnotic
suggestion is used in a reasonable time.</p>

<p>A private, 32, was admitted, April 15, 1916, to Tombleson’s
ward from the Cottonera Mental Ward with the diagnosis:
psychasthenia with paresis of right arm. The man was very
suspicious of the medical profession, melancholy, morose and
prone to tears. He had been kicked by a horse four years
before and showed a depressed and very tender scar in the
right parietal region. The right side of the body since that
injury had been getting weaker, but the arm was much
weaker than the leg. Anesthesia was practically complete
on the right side. There was a wasting of the muscles of
the right arm and the skin of the hand and fingers was thin
and shiny.</p>

<p>Before his transfer the man was placed in the somnambulistic
state, with suggestions of happiness and confidence in the
coming cure. He arrived at Valletta, April 16, in a cheerful
frame of mind, stating that there was nothing now the matter
but weakness. Under somnambulism the loss of symptoms
was suggested and, April 17, the patient was well except for the
loss of power in the arm and leg. Daily training under somnambulism
was given for a period of seven days, with suggestions
especially leveled at the paretic muscles. He was
then so far recovered that hypnotic treatment was stopped.

gait. He had just had several fits&mdash;two March 20,
two March 21, and several earlier. He was tremulous and
could not stand. Much pain. Knee-jerks brisk.</p>

<p>There was a history of a fall into a harbor at seven, followed
by bleeding from nose and ears and unconsciousness
for a week. Convulsions, involving the face, arm and leg,
and attended by unconsciousness, kept recurring until twelve.
Five months before admission there had been cerebrospinal
meningitis. In February at Salonica he had had pneumonia.</p>

<p>March 23-24 the soldier was hypnotized to the third stage,
but he had two fits. A “funny feeling in the right big toe”
was brought out and suggested away. March 26-27 the
patient was able to walk with a typical functional disorder.
Under somnambulism the suggestions were repeated, but on
the evening of March 27 two more convulsions appeared.
In somnambulism he explained that he “had got round”
the inhibition of the aura.</p>

<p>The night of April 2 occurred two convulsions. April 5,
the man was placed in the somnambulistic stage to last three
days. During the night of April 6 he was observed to be
restless for an hour, with some twitching of the right face, yet
no fit followed. The morning of April 8 the patient woke
feeling well. He was again placed in somnambulism to last
two days. Two hours later, however, a fit started. It was
stopped at once by suggestion, but the patient woke. He was
left awake the rest of the day. April 9, somnambulism:
suggestions repeated; sleep to last for two days. That
evening there was a slight beginning of a fit, which was
stopped at once by suggestion, the patient waking April 11
in another beginning of a fit, stopped by suggestion.</p>

<h4><b>Case 549.</b> (<span class="smcap">Binswanger</span>, July, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A subaltern officer, 24, in civil life a student of mathematics,
had serious hereditary taint on both sides (father, alcoholic;
maternal grandfather, victim of “severe nervous disease”).
As a boy he developed normally, and was a good student.
He served as volunteer in 1911 to 1912, but in drill in 1913 he
had had to be released from service on account of nervous
heart and difficulty with respiration.</p>

<p>However, he was called to the colors at the outbreak of
the war, and was subjected to tremendous strain in the
eastern campaign; and he was put in the pack train at the
end of November for cardiac seizures. He had a cellulitis
with furunculosis following, and at the beginning of December
there was suppuration of the whole right tibia. He was
treated in hospital and slowly recovered.</p>

<p>At the beginning of March, 1915, without obvious external
cause, while sitting in a café, the convalescent officer felt
a cramp in his right hand, and strong movements of the hand
to right and left followed. He was treated with bromides,
but unsuccessfully. The tremors became more marked and
then again from time to time grew weaker. Electric treatment
increased the shaking to a maximal degree. April 27,
the patient was brought to the nerve hospital at Jena.</p>

<p>The patient was a fat and muscular man, of average size,
with very small ears and poorly-developed, adherent lobules,
and syndactylism of the second and third toes of both
feet; reflexes increased; marked dermatographia; a static
fine tremor with rapid oscillations. The tremor became a
positive tonus if the arm and hand were stretched out horizontally.
Face and chest reddened easily.</p>

<p>Whenever any other voluntary movement was carried out
(even slight finger movements of the left hand or of the right
or left foot while lying in bed) this right-sided convulsive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_765" id="Page_765">[765]</a></span>
tremor immediately disappeared. The movements could also
be made to disappear by slight turning movements of the
head or of the tongue. Moreover, when the mind was
diverted, as in reading, the tremors ceased. When the
patient thought intensely of some mathematical problem, he
could bring his shaking to a stop. The left grip was stronger
than the right. In the Romberg position there was a marked
swaying to the left and backwards.</p>

<p>Subjectively, the patient complained of nothing but a
circumscribed headache in the left parietal region and of
sleep interrupted by frightful dreams. At first the condition
remained unchanged. There was much insomnia, and the
slightest noise caused fright. Headaches in the daytime also
were produced by any noise, and these headaches were
localized in the left parietal region. The tremors of the
right hand persisted except as he caused them to stop as
above mentioned. He could write well with his left hand.
He would drum with his left hand on the table until the tremor
of his right hand disappeared. He could play on the piano,
playing first with the left hand until the right had become
quiet. He was a very irritable man, passing into anger and
extreme profanity at the slightest occasion, and it was very
difficult to bring him to any kind of orderly activity or persistence
in therapeutic measures. These consisted of baths,
massage, and gymnastics, but they proved quite unavailing.</p>

<p>As the fellow got more and more intolerable, and as upon
May 27 at about 9 o’clock in the evening, he disturbed the
quiet of the entire hospital by a severe paroxysm of scolding,
he was placed in a single room in the psychiatric department.
He was placed in bed, cut off from all communication with
others, and forced to carry out his exercises.</p>

<p>For two days he was surly, crabbed and obstinate, but
then changed his demeanor completely; he became friendly
and obedient. The tremor completely disappeared.</p>

<p>Five days later he was able to carry out all active gymnastic
exercises with great energy and without the slightest disturbance
in the right arm. At date of report he was busy in
the garden.</p>

<p>A grenadier, 21, of healthy stock, physique, and habits,
lost his speech, April 15, 1916, five weeks after going into the
field. May 5, examination showed him a well-nourished
healthy man (lively reflexes and slight dermatographia), able
to communicate only by signs and writing. The laryngoscope
showed almost complete immobility of the two vocal
cords, which lay in the cadaveric position, as in paralysis
of the recurrent nerves. In endeavoring to pronounce the
vowels ā and ee the cords trembled but failed to move toward
each other. The patient’s effort to speak was such that his
head soon got deep red and sweat streamed from the forehead.</p>

<p>Speech exercises were started by passing the electric
current through the larynx during the processes of laryngoscopy.
The patient was meantime assured that his larynx
was healthy and that he would soon learn to speak again.
At the first sitting, the patient felt himself able to cough
aloud.</p>

<p>After a few days, the patient was able to speak the separate
vowels tolerably well, and was then made to go on with such
words as Anna, Otto, Hurrah. The vocal cords began to
move better. Fatigue was a feature of the first treatments,
of such a degree that words that could be pronounced during
the first part of the sitting were lost toward the close.</p>

<p>The grenadier assiduously set himself to say over and over
again the words that he had learned, and would come to the
sister radiant with joy at his success. In ten days he was
able to speak again perfectly, though giving the impression
of a slight stuttering. After three weeks hospital stay he was
discharged cured and fit for service.</p>

side of his head. He came to in a short time. He was
examined in hospital, early in October, and besides a small
skin wound of the head, there was evidence of a wound on
the anterior aspect of the thigh. There was paralysis of both
right arm and right leg, and anesthesia of the entire right side
of the body, face and even of the tongue. There were also
pains over the whole right side of the body. The abdominal
reflexes were present on both sides; the tendon reflexes were
in excess on the hemiplegic side; there were no pathological
reflexes of any sort. The patient’s hearing was diminished,
and he could not speak at all although he could understand
the speech of others perfectly.</p>

<p>Speech returned after a single séance of suggestion with
faradism to the throat. Hearing began to improve. The
patient’s suggestibility was a favorable factor in his cure,
but there were some unfavorable features. One day, he saw
a neighbor go into convulsions and proceeded to develop
convulsions himself. These hysterical convulsions continued.
According to Arinstein, such undesirable complications appear
under conditions of extreme crowding of hospital patients
suffering from shell-shock. Progressive séances of
psychotherapy caused the disappearance of all the signs of
paralysis, and at the time of the report, there was no disability,
except that the full use of the hand had not yet been
regained.</p>

<p>A private, 30, had been 12 years in the service. July 8,
1915, he was partially buried by a shell which killed two
companions.</p>

<p>On admission to hospital he spoke a few sentences but
was deaf, and next morning could neither speak nor read,
nor did he take food for 36 hours thereafter.</p>

<p>Admitted to the King George Hospital, July 18, he was
found stuporous, but started violently if touched, made
signs indicating his wants, took no interest in surroundings,
and resisted efforts to arouse him. He was without signs of
organic disease. It seems that he had been a nervous child,
with nightmares and fits.</p>

<p>July 24, he was given gas for dental extraction, partly in
the hope that he would recover speech; but though he
struggled violently, he made no sound. He had by this
time become rather intelligent in a childlike manner, being
pleased to see his small boy, but taking no notice of his wife.
It transpired afterward that he did not recognize her.</p>

<p>Phonation in whisper now began. There was then a relapse,
and for a week or more no food was taken. Such
relapses with irritation and hypobulia and an obstinate
constipation recurred; but improvement came on slowly.
He became able to read short printed words, and later
handwriting.</p>

<p>For another month there was no improvement and he
lost heart and the will to get well, brightening up only when
offered a motor drive or something else pleasant. He was
transferred to an auxiliary hospital, against his will, September
18.</p>

<p>November 1, he was brought back to the King George Hospital,
excited, shouting, struggling and evidently drunk. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_769" id="Page_769">[769]</a></span>
a day’s leave from the convalescent hospital he had come up
to London, and in alcoholic elation began to laugh and talk.
Morphia did not reduce his violence. He insisted on seeing
the physician, to tell him the good news. Hearing was still
diminished, though if attention were diverted, direct answers
were given to some questions. Sleep followed.</p>

<p>The next day he spoke perfectly but could hear nothing.
There was no further progress for three weeks, though he
occasionally caught sounds. He now became bright and
pleasant and had lost all irritability and sulkiness. Galvanic
and faradic current had no effect on the ears.</p>

<p>November 27, after elaborate preparation to heighten the
suggestive effect, the patient was kept in bed and given gas
and ether up to the abolition of the corneal reflex. As he was
coming round, the doctor shouted that he could now hear well.
He was overcome with joy and had hysterical convulsions.
He could hear, but with the right ear only. In point of fact,
the left ear on examination showed signs of labyrinthine deafness.
He was placed on home service.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> etherization for functional deafness and mutism, Ninian
Bruce maintains that ether is more satisfactory than chloroform.
The loss of consciousness in cases of deafness and
mutism ought to be a relatively slight one, and the patient
should be suddenly roused to the realization that he is speaking.
Recovery from chloroform anesthesia is, according to
Ninian Bruce, too slow to allow the patient to catch the
point that he is now speaking and hearing when he was
formerly dumb or deaf. A failure with the method is a bad
thing for the patient, as he loses confidence in the method,
whereupon some other method must be resorted to.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> etherization for deafmutism, see technic of Ninian
Bruce under <a href="#case553">Case 553</a>. Penhallow has a case in which
during primary etherization the patient reviewed in a loud
voice the whole story of his speech loss. He was found to
have recovered speech and hearing after coming out of ether.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> anesthesia by gas, Abrahams has used nitrous oxide for
cure of hysterical paraplegia. Proctor also reports the use
of light ether anesthesia for bringing out the voice of functional
mutes.</p>

Yes-No test. Cure by suggestion on emerging

</div>

<h4><b>Case 553.</b> (<span class="smcap">Bruce</span>, May, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A soldier was admitted to the Royal Victoria Hospital,
Edinburgh, completely deaf in the left ear. He had been
under shell fire a number of times in France and was eventually
thrown down and made unconscious by a shell explosion
on his left. He did not remember the noise of the
explosion or anything until he found himself in hospital.
After the explosion he had begun to stutter, and the stuttering
had grown worse. Examination of the ear indicated that
the deafness was functional. He was given ether and when
just under was asked if he could hear anything spoken in his
right ear. He said, “Yes.” With the right ear closed he
was asked if he could hear when his left ear was spoken into.
He said, “No.” This test was repeated several times.
After covering his right ear, he gave his name, regiment,
etc., in reply to questions whispered into his left (previously
deaf) ear. The incongruity was pointed out. He was now
suddenly wakened. He laughed hysterically with joy over
his recovery.</p>

<p>But the next morning he was again stone deaf in the left
ear. Blistering and electricity failed to produce benefit. He
was, however, puzzled about himself.</p>

<p>After a fortnight he was again given ether and a little
chloroform was added. The yes-no test was again positive.
He was allowed to recover gradually from the chloroform, but
he had now lost recollection of what had happened. The
left ear remained deaf. Ether was again given. He was
asked to close his right ear with his finger. While answering
questions addressed to his left ear, he was suddenly awakened
and immediately said that his hearing had come back.
This return proved permanent. He returned to his dépôt.
In the conversations under ether there was no stuttering.
He had been totally deaf in the left ear for five months.</p>

<p>Blow in neck by rifle butt: aphasia, right hemiplegia

MEDICAL suggestion) trismus: Recovery by anesthetic
and suggestion.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 554.</b> (<span class="smcap">Arinstein</span>, September, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A Russian soldier was struck in the head and neck by a
rifle butt, and developed paralysis of right arm and leg with
loss of speech. After the excitement experienced by the
patient when exhibited to the students by the late Prof. M. N.
Szukowsky in the neurological clinic of the Military Medical
Academy, trismus developed.</p>

<p>The patient spent a year in various hospitals, the most
diverse methods of treatment by drug therapy, electricity,
and suggestion yielding no results. The patient had to be
fed chiefly by nose and rectum, though small quantities of
fluids were fed through the mouth through an opening formed
by the falling out of one tooth in the upper jaw. The patient
became greatly emaciated and weak and was, October 29,
1915, brought into the nervous wards of the hospital.</p>

<p>He showed flaccid paralysis of left arm and leg, together
with anesthesia, analgesia and thermanesthesia over the whole
left side of the head, extreme general atrophy of muscles,
somewhat more marked on the palsied side. The temperature
of the paralyzed half of the body was not lowered. No
knee or Achilles reflex obtained upon either the affected or
the healthy side (general exhaustion?). Abdominal and
testicular reflexes lively. The pupils responded well to
light. Corneal reflexes lively. The neck was held awry to
the left, and the head was inclined somewhat downwards and
leftwards; hearing on left side impaired. The jaws could
not be opened even with the greatest effort. Wassermann
reaction negative.</p>

<p>Patient thought himself incurable. Purves Stewart’s case,
in which chloroform and oxide of nitrogen were used, was the
basis of Arinstein’s treatment. It was suggested to the
patient that he submit to narcosis with the proviso that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_772" id="Page_772">[772]</a></span>
would not be operated upon. His consent was secured;
with the coöperation of others, the chloroform was administered
November 6. The stage of excitability was not well
marked. 8 gr. of chloroform was used altogether, by the
drop system. Nevertheless, even with the weak initial
excitability, the patient became capable of some movements
with paralyzed hand and foot. On opening mouth, the
patient yawned yet uttered no sound. Between the jaws
was put a rubber insertion and upon awakening the patient
was let see with his own eyes that his jaws were open and that
therefore food might be introduced through the mouth.
Upon repetition of the narcosis, 5 gr. of chloroform was used
altogether, and the stage of excitability was this time better
marked. To strengthen movements in the paralyzed extremities,
the device of pricking the patient with a pin on
the unaffected half of the body, with the unaffected hand and
leg held horizontal by assistants, was adopted. The patient
then made reflex defensive movements in the paralyzed
extremities, especially the hand. At this point the narcosis
was suspended, and the irritation with the pin was continued
until consciousness returned. At this moment, the
patient’s attention was called to the disappearance of the
paralysis and his restored ability to move the paralyzed extremities.</p>

<p>From that time on, the patient’s condition underwent a
sharp transition. Artificial feeding became unnecessary.
The patient ate by mouth; the mouth was opened by the
leverage of a small stick held by the patient between his teeth.
Speech returned gradually. In reading aloud the patient
aided the movements of his lips with his hands. At the
time of report the patient spoke well, ate normally, had gained
in weight, and with some effort could sit down and even stand
and walk. All this was attained in a relatively short time
after a whole year of paralysis.</p>

<p>The author felt that the success attained in this case gave
him the right to use the same method where the cause was
not a contusion.</p>

</div>

<h4><b>Case 555.</b> (<span class="smcap">Arinstein</span>, September, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A Russian private, 30, brought to a field reserve hospital,
June 20, 1915, was in a grave condition diagnosed typhoid.
By the end of June the general condition had improved and
the temperature had fallen.</p>

<p>July 9, worse; happening to be in the company of a sanitary
in a privy, he was observed suddenly to fall unconscious,
with both feet and left arm paralyzed. Soon afterward he
lost the power of speech. From September 30 to October
19, he lay in field hospital; but was then transferred to the
nerve hospital with diagnosis: convulsive paralysis and
aphasia. At entrance, complete paralysis of both legs and
left hand; loss of speech and aphonia (speech understood).
Upon touching a foot, strong convulsions developed with legs
rapidly drawn apart and drawn together much in the manner
of dancing toys. The mouth was twisted to the left.
Though he silently opened his mouth and made rapid movements
with the lower jaw, he could not utter a single sound,
either vowel or consonant. Left hypalgesia. Hypesthesia
of skin of hand and mucosa of tongue. Knee-jerks absent
because of the strain of the muscles of the legs. Wassermann
negative.</p>

<p>The history showed that the speech of the patient had been
incorrect and indistinct from childhood. Moreover, in 1908,
in chopping wood in the forest he had fallen under a sleigh
and hurt his left hand, which had not since fully recovered.
He had volunteered for the war.</p>

<p>The psychogenic character of the disease seemed clear.
Suggestion was followed by ether narcosis, during which, on
pricks of the healthy side with a pin, the patient made
defensive movements with the paralyzed hands, and also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_774" id="Page_774">[774]</a></span>
moved both legs. Speech was not regained either during
or immediately after the narcosis, although the patient gave
forth indefinite sounds. Speech was restored on the same
day, September 7, with verbal suggestion and faradic brush
applied to palate. The patient at once began to speak
clearly and distinctly, read his prayer book, and described
distinctly and in detail how he went to war. From that
moment the convulsive movements in the feet disappeared,
the region of anesthesia on the left side narrowed, speech
was permanently reëstablished, and the patient began to
move with his feet and finally began to walk after six months
of paralysis. Before that time no medical treatment had had
the slightest effect. The effort to stop mechanically the
jerks even temporarily by means of plaster casts had been
unsuccessful. In sleep the twitches ceased, but upon reawakening,
even before full consciousness returned, the
jerkings would resume. It is curious to note that upon
falling asleep under the anesthetic the patient would issue
always one and same kind of yells&mdash;“<i>Help, there goes the
German! They are shooting! Russians, do not yield!</i>”</p>

<p><i>Re</i> chloroform anesthesia, Milligan remarks that the treatment
should be carried out in a quiet, single room, with the
chloroform slowly administered and the suggestions made
by the anesthetist during the optimal phase for suggestion,&mdash;just
before the stage of involuntary struggling.</p>

<p>A private, 23, was admitted to the Duchess of Connaught’s
Hospital at Taplow from Gallipoli, September 10, 1915.
A shell had exploded behind this man. He had been picked
up, unconscious, and remained so about a day. He recovered
without the power of speech. Cerebration was slow
at first but improved steadily.</p>

<p>The man had been a professional musician. Curiously
enough, though his ability to read ordinary print was as good
as ever, his reading of music was lost with the speech.</p>

<p>September 20, he was etherized, but being of a phlegmatic
type, he was not readily excited and took the anesthesia very
quietly. After perseverance, however, he was induced to
talk. The ability to read music returned with the voice.
He was discharged, October 4, 1915.</p>

<h4><b>Case 557.</b> (<span class="smcap">Gradenigo</span>, March, 1917.)</h4>

<p>An Italian infantryman was buried under Mt. Zebio after
shell explosion. After 24 hours he was found and dug out.
He remained unconscious for 13 days and came out absolutely
deaf and mute.</p>

<p>At hospital he was markedly depressed and cried very
readily on being spoken to. The tympanic membrane had
lost its sensitiveness to pain. As for the speech mechanism,
the larynx proved negative. All the movements of the soft
palate, tongue and vocal cords could be normally performed.
The tongue was anesthetic to touch, but the taste function
was perfectly preserved. The cheeks and various parts of
the face were also anesthetic to touch, and the lobules of the
ears could even be pierced with large pins without reaction
by the patient.</p>

<p>He tried to pronounce labials, opening and closing the lips
rapidly; but the expiratory movement was too weak, and
not a single sound was made.</p>

<p>At the patient’s request, he was chloroformed. During a
very violent excited phase, he did emit groaning sounds.
The narcosis, however, did not put an entire stop to the
mutism, since only a few inarticulate sounds could be emitted,
and those only after great efforts. Curiously enough,
however, the chloroform narcosis had caused the <i>deafness</i> to
disappear entirely. Another narcosis upon the patient’s
insistent request was given but remained without results,
and at the time of report, the patient though cheerful and
intelligent-looking, was still mute.</p>

<h4><b>Cases 558 and 559.</b> (<span class="smcap">Smyly</span>, April, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A soldier was out with a bombing party when a shell burst.
He came to in a casualty clearing station, and was sent on to
Salonica, deaf, dumb and jumpy. Two months later, an
attempt at hypnosis failed; faradism of vocal cords failed.</p>

<p>The patient dreamed one night that if he vomited he could
speak. Ipecac produced vomiting without speech. The
patient, however, wanted a second dose, and while waiting
for it, uttered an exclamation, which he did not himself hear,
however. In the meantime, Dr. Smyly had been trying to
hypnotize a second soldier, dumb but not deaf. This man’s
dug-out had been blown in on him seven months before,
whereupon the patient became very shaky, but did not become
sick for a week. He was then sent to hospital, and his
voice gradually disappeared. He suffered from violent
headache and spasmodic movements of the arms and legs.
Suggestion seemed powerless, and ether was unexpectedly
given to the patient. While going under the ether, he said,
“Oh dear, oh dear” several times indistinctly. It seems
that another physician had already tried to cure the patient
of dumbness by removing teeth without an anesthetic.</p>

<p>While this therapy was proceeding with the dumb man,
the deaf-and-dumb man disappeared. It seems that the
smell of the gas had caused him to take refuge on an outhouse-roof.
The next day he had recovered voice and
hearing completely, partly from shock and partly through
suggestion.</p>

<p>The etherized patient did not recover voice but lost the
spasmodic movements and his insomnia. A week later
ether was again administered, and the patient was strapped
down; as he was coming to, faradism was applied to the head
and face. The patient then quickly recovered his voice and
still retains it.</p>

<h4><b>Case 560.</b> (<span class="smcap">Claude</span>, March, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A sergeant was struck in the suprapubic region, December
15, 1915, by a shell fragment and got a large hematoma in
the perineal region (shell fragment visible on X-ray). The
man was treated a year in a center for physiotherapy and was
then treated in a neurological center, where a faulty position
of the right thigh maintained in extensor rotation and abduction
was found. The patient walked on crutches, legs
wide apart, balancing with body.</p>

<p>Upon transfer to Bourges, an intraspinal injection of stovaine
(after withdrawal of 2-3 cc. fluid, 1 cc. stovaine,
0.07 to the cc., mixed with cerebrospinal fluid) was made.
This reduced the contracture and permitted the patient to
place his legs parallel. They were then bandaged in the
parallel position. The bandages were removed two days
later and the limbs did not reassume their faulty position.
The man was shortly able to walk with a cane; progress was
rapid. This man was very desirous of cure and refused
to be invalided, believing he was to be cured, and had received
medal and war cross. Simple motor reëducation in
competent hands had been without effect. A new kind of
measure, such as stovaine, proved successful.</p>

<p>A chasseur, buried June 24, 1916, had a number of general
symptoms, apparently got well and was given seven days’
leave at home. On the way he felt abdominal pain which
he thought due to the jolting of the car. Suddenly he felt his
legs trembling on extension. He left the train and went into
a hospital where a diagnosis of radicular and spinal lesions
was made. Two months later he was sent to Claude who
found that he could walk only with knees flexed. If he was
requested to stand up and extend his legs on the thigh, a
trembling set in suggestive of an epileptoid trepidation.
Even in the horizontal position the same clonic trepidation
occurred which only stopped if the patient flexed his legs on
the thighs.</p>

<p>However, no sign of organic lesion could be found. There
was an analgesia limited to the ankles. Psycho-physiotherapeutic
treatment was unavailing. January 28, 1917,
the stovaine injection method was tried. After anesthesia
had set in, it was found possible still to produce the spastic
state by extending the legs; but a half hour after injection
the spastic state could no longer be produced. The patient
was shown that the trepidation was abolished. During the
period of return of sensibility, the legs were constantly moved
and the patient constantly told to make movements himself.
He was convinced of his power. There was no longer any
clonus. The patient remained all day in bed without epileptiform
movements. Next day he complained merely of
weakness in the legs and was got to walk without having
convulsive tremors. During the next few days he began to
walk with a cane, later without support, and there were no
more contractions except transiently in the left leg if the
patient walked a little too long. He left the hospital cured.</p>

<h4><b>Case 562.</b> (<span class="smcap">Bellin</span> and <span class="smcap">Vernet</span>, January, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A soldier in a colonial regiment was sent, August 14, 1916,
to an evacuation post with a diagnosis “deafness following
shell-shock, unfit for service.” The patient asked that he
be spoken to very loud because he could not hear, and he
himself spoke in whispers. He kept watching his interlocutors’
lips and moved his own as if to pronounce the words.</p>

<p>A shell had burst nearby fourteen months before in June,
1915. After being in several hospitals, he was sent to an
oto-rhino-laryngological service where he had his hearing
reëducated and was taught lip reading. It was soon perceived
that he could hear without lip reading and he was
assured that he could be cured at once, but naturally he was
not convinced. He produced a carefully filed paper stating
“atrophic ozenous rhinitis, deafness from labyrinthine shock
following shell explosion, hearing diminished 60 per cent right,
30 per cent left.”</p>

<p>However, energetic psychotherapy was started and in the
absence of electricity, subcutaneous injections of ether were
given. Such patients had always been cured, and a drug
injected under the skin, not dangerous but extremely painful
would cure him! This treatment was carried out in a dugout
near enough to the lines to be daily “potted.” The patient
was left for a space to reflect, and he finally accepted the
chance of cure. He was exhorted to stand courageously the
pain and to breathe deeply and to repeat a word more and
more loudly. Finally he was made to speak normally and
eventually to cry out loudly. He now felt much astonished,
and in his astonishment forgot his deafness. He said that
he had never spoken or heard since the accident, that he had
been a deafmute from the first month of his illness, and that
for the last three months he had been able to speak only in
a whispered voice.</p>

<p>He should have been watched a few days to confirm the
cure. This was impossible in the crowded dugout and no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_781" id="Page_781">[781]</a></span>
risk could be run of his escaping. Kept over night he was
found next day unable to hear and talking in the same
voice as before.</p>

<p>He was now found to be either an exaggerator or a simulator.
He was given a half hour to exercise his voice in and
told that he must succeed unless he was a simulator. At
the end of half an hour it was found that he had skipped.
He was sent back by the division surgeon with orders to send
him to the otological service for inquiry. The otological
service found an atrophic ozenous rhinitis, a normal larynx,
perfect audition. He was given a psychic X-raying and a
few electric sparks were also drawn from his neck. He then
began to talk in a loud voice and to hear normally. August
30, he was sent out completely cured and rejoined his regiment.</p>

<h4><b>Case 563.</b> (<span class="smcap">Adrian</span> and <span class="smcap">Yealland</span>, June, 1917.)</h4>

a persistent functional paralysis of the arm, which had successfully
withstood hypnotism, psychoanalysis, rest, massage,
anesthesia with ether, and painful electrical treatment.</p>

and was prepared to discuss his condition exhaustively. He
was told, however, that he had come to be cured and that
the nature of his cure would be explained to him afterwards.
Without further discussion, the motor areas of the cortex
were mapped out rapidly. The measurements were repeated
aloud to impress and mystify the patient. He was assured
that as soon as the shoulder area of the cortex was stimulated
faradically, he would be able to raise his shoulder, and that
then the rest of his arm would recover. An exceedingly
mild faradic current was then applied to the scalp for a few
moments and he was then ordered to move his shoulder. He
did so at once. In a few minutes, all of the paralysis had
vanished and the patient could raise 30 pounds. Adrian and
Yealland believe that the success here was largely due to the
fact that the patient was not allowed to discuss the case or
criticize the treatment beforehand.</p>

<p>It is essential that the patient should be convinced that
the physicians understand the case and can cure him. No
physical sign should be examined as if it were interesting or
obscure. An attitude of “mild boredom bred of perfect
familiarity with the patient’s disorder” is cultivated. If the
case is exhibited it should be exhibited “as a perfect example”
of the type of case that is cured in five minutes by appropriate
treatment. “Rapidity and an authoritative manner are the
chief factors in the reëducative process.”</p>

<p>Brachial monoplegia following use of sling after
bruise or wound. Technique of electrical suggestion
and rapid reëducation.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 564.</b> (<span class="smcap">Adrian and Yealland</span>, June, 1917.)</h4>

<p>Adrian and Yealland give the following typical case of
paralysis of the arm as a very frequent and very curable
form of war neurosis, occurring as a rule after a slight wound
or bruise necessitating the use of a sling. The patient, having
received a slight wound of the forearm, for months had
a useless arm, which he could move but slightly at the
shoulder on exerting a superhuman effort. Occasionally he
could flex the fingers through a small angle. There was
complete anesthesia of the hand and arm of long-glove type.
This anesthesia was not complained of, and might not be
noticed until suggested to the patient by the physician. It
is well to elicit the anesthesia, however, in view of the treatment
to be applied. There was no wasting of muscles; the
sensory loss was typical of hysterical anesthesia; nor could
the whole arm have been involved by an injury that did not
affect the upper arm and shoulder.</p>

<p>The patient was told that he was very lucky to have come
off with such a slight injury; his arm was to be set right in five
minutes by the application of a special form of electricity.
He was then made to sit on a large pad electrode connected
with an induction coil; the other terminal is connected
with a wire brush. The first effect, he was told, would be
the return of feeling in the forearm; power would return
with the feeling. The wire brush with a fairly strong current
was drawn downwards over the forearm from elbow to
wrist. He was told that he could now feel as far as the
wrist, and a pin was used to convince him that he could thus
feel. If he had not felt the pinprick, the current would have
been increased in strength until he could feel. The hand was
now treated in the same way.</p>

<p>He was now told that, as feeling had returned to the arm,
the power of movement would be restored shortly. Adrian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_784" id="Page_784">[784]</a></span>
and Yealland remark that laymen seem to consider that loss
of power and loss of feeling are inseparably connected. The
electrode was now used to produce contraction in the muscles.
Under these circumstances, the arm will be used hesitatingly,
with an appearance of great effort; but the patient
is nevertheless convinced that power is returning.</p>

<p>“Rapid reëducation follows at once. He is given no
time to think, but urged to move the arm more and more
strongly, to grip the physician’s hand, to flex and extend the
elbow, etc., and the pressure is not relaxed until the whole
arm has returned to its normal vigor. If recovery is stationary,
faradization is repeated with stronger and stronger currents.
If it seems as though he might relapse on leaving the
hospital, he is told that this is very unlikely, but that if it
should occur, he should report sick at once and come back
for treatment with a current far stronger than that already
used.”</p>

<p>Adrian and Yealland claim that they have applied their
combination of suggestion and reëducation in more than 250
cases (including 82 cases of mutism, 34 of deafness, 18 of
aphonia, 37 brachial or crural monoplegia, 46 paraplegia,
16 hemiplegia, and 18 of non-organic gait disturbance), and
that although a majority of the cases have been of several
months’ standing, treatment has been almost immediately
successful in at least 95 per cent of the cases.</p>

<p>Exposure in the retreat from Mons: Persistent
hysterical sciatica. Treatment by faradism and
verbal suggestion.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 565.</b> (<span class="smcap">Harris</span>, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A soldier developed pains about the hips and down the
right thigh after getting wet through in the retreat from
Mons, August, 1914. He was treated for a period of nine
months in various convalescent homes and military hospitals,
incidentally receiving forty baths at Droitwich. He hobbled
on a stick, leaning upon the left leg and dragging the right
stiffly. The thigh was tender and hyperesthetic.</p>

<p>The proper treatment of cases of hysteria, according to
Harris, is strong faradism, applied by a small electrode or
wire brush to the moistened skin. The stimulus is made
powerful enough to force the patient to admit that he feels.
The theory is that the powerful stimulation “breaks down
the psychical auto-inhibition which produces the hysterical
anesthesia.”</p>

<p>Faradism is only the first phase of the treatment. Verbal
suggestion follows. Building on the basis of the feeling produced
by the faradism or on the basis of the ocular evidence
of motion in the hitherto paralyzed muscles, the patient is
informed that the electricity will now be more and more
strongly felt and that he will be cured in a few minutes.</p>

<p>The two elements in the therapy, then, are: encouraging
verbal suggestion and the suggestion afforded by the paraphernalia
of a complex looking, noisy machine. The
knowledge on the part of the patient that a powerful and
mysterious stimulus, namely, electricity, is being employed
is a third element of suggestion.</p>

<p>Persistent hysterical sciatica, such as that of the present
case, may require prolonged treatment. In this instance, the
man was completely cured in five minutes, so that he was
made able to run across the room. He said he would now be
able to go back to the front, and wondered why he could not
have been cured before.</p>

<p>Prognosis of intensive reëducation in reflex
(physiopathic) disorder&mdash;complete recovery (except
for the hysterical fraction of the disease) not
expected.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 566.</b> (<span class="smcap">Vincent</span>, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A young soldier was superficially wounded in the left knee,
in August, 1914. A year later, he showed amyotrophy of the
left calf, which measured 2.5 cm. less than the right, a weak
slow Achilles reflex on the left side, cyanosis and hypothermia
of the left foot, weakness and limitation of movements in the
left foot, with slight contracture in flexion of leg upon thigh.</p>

<p>Thenceforward and for eight months, this soldier was submitted
at the Tours Centre to intensive reëducation. For
two hours every day upon prescription he walked, ran, and
hopped upon the left leg. In September, 1916, after twelve
month’s training, there was a certain improvement in his
disorder. The leg was now completely extended upon the
thigh, and the amplitude in the movement of the foot was
almost normal; but the amyotrophy, vasomotor disorder
and certain electrical disturbances remained quite unchanged.
The man himself recognized that his status was greatly improved,
but he could not walk more than four or five kilometers
without great fatigue.</p>

<p>In view of the inferior results of reëducation in some of
these cases, should any attempt at all be made to reëducate?
Vincent thinks that that should be; but that it should be
borne in mind that sometimes no results may be obtained.
If the reflex disorder (in the Babinski sense) is minimal and
the chief difficulty is hysterical, then sometimes the man may
go back to service after reëducation; but in intense examples
of reflex (physiopathic) disorder, invaliding has often proved
necessary.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> values of intensive reëducation, Vincent’s technique
and results have logical resemblances to those of Yealland
and of Kaufmann. Vincent established in the 9th district
neurological center a method of intensive reëducation which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_787" id="Page_787">[787]</a></span>
is particularly suited to <i>old</i> hysterical cases. He divides
the treatment into three stages: First, the stage called by
the <i>poilu</i> by the picturesque name of <i>torpillage</i>; secondly,
the stage of fixation; thirdly, the stage of training. According
to Roussy and Lhermitte, there are few cases at the
front suitable for the treatment of Clovis Vincent, which is
especially devised for the old cases. See under <a href="#case574">Case 574</a>
for further details of Vincent’s treatment.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> prognosis of the physiopathic disorder, there has been
some controversy in France. See discussion under <a href="#case530">Case 530</a>.
<i>Re</i> suitable treatment for physiopathic disorders, Babinski
and Froment suggested the application of heat. The warm
bath test is also of value in diagnosis. Babinski and Froment
claim progressive improvements with hot baths, hot
air douches, and light baths&mdash;but counsel great prudence.
The improvement is never rapid.</p>

<p>Wound of calf; operations: hysterical contracture
with “physiopathic” features. “Brutally conquered”
by reëducation.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 567.</b> (<span class="smcap">Ferrand</span>, March, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A French infantryman, class of 1912, was wounded, May
12, 1915, in the upper third of the right calf. His posterior
tibial artery had to be ligated. In a few weeks the wound
was healed, but he began to walk badly, presenting a contracture
of the calf with retraction of the tendo Achillis.</p>

<p>Toward the last of 1915 a surgeon under the impression
that the disease was organic cut the tendo Achillis but the
soldier could not walk any better. As he could not take the
position of equinism, he semiflexed his knee and walked upon
a crutch.</p>

<p>Another surgeon was now found to perform a tenotomy on
the flexors of the leg and put the patient in a plaster cast to
correct the flexion and immobilize in extension. This second
operation was in July, 1916. The patient now walked without
a crutch.</p>

<p>He was then sent to a neurological center, Dec. 8, 1916,
walking on two canes, right leg in forced extension on thigh,
in permanent and absolute contracture. All movements except
leg flexion could be executed, though slowly and weakly;
but positive movements were impossible, except flexion of
the knees. There was no sensory disorder. Reflexes were
normal save that the leg reflexes were a little stronger on the
affected side, and the patellar reflex on that side was nullified
by the contracture. Electrical reactions proved normal.
There were marked trophic disturbances of the right foot and
of the lower third of the lower leg. There was a certain
amount of edema, cyanosis, coldness and thickening of skin;
marked muscular over-excitability of the distal extremity of
the leg. In short, Ferrand was here dealing with a case of
Babinski’s group of the so-called physiopathic cases. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_789" id="Page_789">[789]</a></span>
man was somewhat feeble-minded, and anxious and a trembling
suppliant for cure.</p>

<p>He was put, December 15, in a reëducation room and by
means of fatigue, induced by violent physical exercises, was
(Ferrand states) “brutally conquered.” The contracture
after a half hour of physical movement of flexion and extension
of the leg ceased. The patient was shown how he
could himself both flex and extend the limb himself; he was
then caused to do this spontaneously. These active movements
were aided and at times provoked by somewhat painful
galvanic discharges. The patient then walked slowly,
and flexed both knees to the maximum. He was cured after
a treatment of 2½ hours. There were, of course, some (surgical)
intra-articular adhesions in the knee and it was necessary
for the patient to break these adhesions. An X-ray
had shown the bone to be intact. A slight hydrarthrosis
developed the next day, but a few days later he was able to
walk as well as anyone. For five weeks he followed a training
platoon in the reëducation work and was evacuated,
January 23, 1917, to his station, though he had entered the
neurological center with the idea that he was to be invalided
with a pension.</p>

<p>He had a few relics of physiomotor disorder when he left,
including the abnormal delicacy of skin and muscular over-excitability
above mentioned. On the basis of this and similar
cases Ferrand believes that, although the physiopathic
group of Babinski exists, it does not signify a separate clinical
syndrome and the occurrence of physiopathic symptoms does
not contraindicate psychotherapy.</p>

<h4><b>Case 568.</b> (<span class="smcap">Turrell</span>, January, 1915.)</h4>

<p>Turrell, in a paper on electrotherapy at a base hospital,
narrates a case of spinal concussion which rapidly yielded to
the persuasive influence of Bergonié’s machine for electrically
provoked exercises. Turrell grants that such a rapid
cure would probably be attributed to suggestion, but thinks
that the term <i>demonstration</i> might be preferred on account of
the vigor and amplitude of the muscular contractions excited.</p>

<p>This soldier was driving an ammunition wagon at the
front, when a shell exploded under the wagon, killing one
horse and severely wounding the other. The patient himself
was blown into the air, fell, dragged himself to a trench
where he lay all night, and found himself in the morning
unable to walk or stand. He recalls that pins were stuck
into his legs by the examining medical officer and that they
produced no sensation. When he was finally brought to the
Third Southern Medical Hospital, he was unable to draw up
or move his legs, or to stand up (yet neurologically normal).</p>

<p>After a few days’ rest in bed, he found himself able to
walk a few steps with assistance, and was then transferred to
the Radcliffe Infirmary for electrical treatment. This treatment
consisted in electrically provoked exercises to the back
(positive) and seat and thighs (negative). He was able to
walk back to his ward, leaning on a wheelchair. Next day
he walked to the electrical department with sticks, and after
the exercises were repeated, he was found able to walk without
assistance. On the third day, the Morton wave current
was applied to the back, to clear up any persistent stiffness.
The patient was then discharged on sick furlough.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> the Morton wave and similar applications of electricity,
Zeehandelaar speaks of a high frequency hall fitted up at
Berlin. Touching the walls of the hall with the finger elicited
a powerful spark. The scheme appeared to be on a commercial
basis, and it was proposed to start similar institutions
for poor metabolism and neuroses in other cities.</p>

<h4><b>Case 569.</b> (<span class="smcap">Voss</span>, November, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A soldier in service from the outbreak of war, shot in
September, 1915, afterward suffering from fainting spells,
was treated in several hospitals. He developed a typhoid
fever at Lindau, which was at first taken for hysterical fever.
Eventually he came to the observation of Voss, unable to
stand and falling hysteria-wise if compelled to walk.</p>

<p>Thorough examination was made. It was emphatically
explained to him that there could be no reason why he should
not stand or walk.</p>

<p>A miracle occurred. From the second day of his hospital
stay he not only walked about but began to polish doors and
windows with inexhaustible strength.</p>

<p>But when he was about to be told that he must now be
looked upon as well, the miracle was not so manifest. It
now transpired that he had serious gaps of memory and
disorders in recognition, a sphincter disorder and ever since
his typhoid incontinence with fluid feces.</p>

<p>In short, waking suggestion had caused a very prominent
symptom to disappear, but the total personality remained
sick. According to Voss, the procedures of Kaufmann are
dubious just because they cannot stand the test of time.
Yet so far as the cure of this man’s astasia-abasia was concerned,
it was not at all unlike the cures wrought at Lourdes.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> miracles of this sort, see cases of Colin Russel (503
and 504) as well as those of Veale (511 and 512). Voss’
arguments run parallel with the contentions of various persons
that the miracle cures (such as those by anesthesia,
electric suggestion, and hypnosis), do not get sufficiently to
the bottom of the affections in question. Buzzard, in the
preface to Yealland’s book on the <i>Hysterical Disorders of
Warfare</i>, remarks that the question of the ultimate prognosis
in cases thus suddenly cured must be left unanswered.</p>

<p>Dysbasia after a fall: “Kaufmann” cure in six
weeks.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 570.</b> (<span class="smcap">Schultze</span>, August, 1916.)</h4>

<p>Severe dysbasia, due to monoplegia of the right leg of
sudden origin (a fall), was variously treated 64 weeks without
effect.</p>

<p>July 15, 1916, the patient walked in on a stick, and fell
down on trying to walk without. August 1, 1916, at 9
o’clock, he was rapidly examined: Anesthesia to pain and
temperature; inability to lift right foot; the right knee could
be lifted about a hand-breadth above the body if the foot
was supported.</p>

<p>At 9:10, a small electrode was applied: sensibility became
normal at once. Second application: leg raised much
better. The man was told that he was better and that his
hand could be put under the heel. Third application: Leg
raised 8 cm. The patient showed pleasure at the advance.
Fourth application (slightly increased strength): Patient
able to stand and to lift knee with flexion at 135° while
standing. Walking exercises under direction. At 9:30, five
minutes recess was given for fatigue, whereupon the exercises
were taken up again and transition made from stationary
running to walking without aid as well as a variety of
other associated acts (grasping handkerchief instead of
physician’s hand, and the like). The patient became exhausted
after 8 or 9 minutes running about, and another
pause was given.</p>

<p>The large brush electrode with stronger current was now
given to the back and to the back of the right leg. Practice
in slow walking, lifting knee, and holding hip joint firm.
The patient became tired, but remained very willing. Exercises
in pulling on stockings, in climbing stairs&mdash;the
whole concluded at 10 o’clock, whereupon it was found that
the patient could walk alone for a distance of 50 meters.
The patient was a very suggestible one. It was striking that
the patient in the time between 9:35 and 9:40 minutes could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_793" id="Page_793">[793]</a></span>
walk better on the right (that is, the previously affected leg)
than upon the left. Rest in bed and phenacetine were
ordered, with the suggestion that in the morning he would
walk much better. He became irritated after the treatment
but grew quieter in the afternoon.</p>

<p>On August 3, he was found able to walk well, better when
not observed than when observed. August 5, he complained
that his leg was worse and used a cane, without permission.
He was roundly scolded by the physician and threatened
with being sent to bed if he did not practice earnestly. August
7, he was better, and confessed that he could not walk
as well on command as he could alone; the exercises were
nothing but a fraud and he could go out and beat everything
up (<i>alles zerschlagen</i>) if he did not have to carry out such
exercises.</p>

<p>August 15, he was much better, quiet, and satisfied. The
lameness was practically gone. August 30, there was no
sign of lameness, even when he was observed. According to
Schultze, the Kaufmann method is not merely an Erb tradition,
and rather special measures need to be taken in executing
it.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> Kaufmann’s cure, Imboden sums up this “highly logical
and brutal method” as a method in which powerful
electric shocks and loud military orders to perform certain
exercises secure results. Imboden suggests that relapses
may follow, sometimes on the slightest provocation. Mann
states that Kaufmann’s method of suggestion and electric
shock forms very good treatment; yet Mann states there
have been two deaths under this treatment: in both instances
there was an enlarged thymus at autopsy. A better
technique, especially the use of the faradic current alone,
might have avoided these deaths. Mann himself prefers to
Kaufmann’s <i>Ueberrumpelung</i> milder methods, such as rest.
Kaufmann keeps up the sitting until the man is cured, even
if it takes two hours of electricity and staccato commands.

</div>

<h4><b>Case 571.</b> (<span class="smcap">Hewat</span>, March, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A reënlisted soldier arrived at the Royal Victoria Hospital,
as a case of ulnar paralysis. He had been wounded in France
six months before by a bullet which passed through the
fleshy part of the shoulder, above the middle third of the
clavicle. Power in the right arm gradually diminished;
yet two months after the wound he seemed fit enough to be
sent to Egypt. The paresis developed, and in a month’s
time he was invalided home. He had been unable to use a
rifle for months.</p>

<p>The healed bullet wounds were found about the region of
the brachial plexus. The patient was sure the bullet had
damaged the nerves in that region. The right arm and hand
were limp and over-inclined to blueness, and the muscles
were flabby. Active movements of all sorts could be carried
out with the arm but not against resistance. There was a
definite anesthesia and analgesia throughout, and responses
to touch and pain stimuli were irregular.</p>

<p>By way of treatment, the patient had the muscles of the
paretic arm stimulated electrically, and at the same time
he was told that no nerve of the neck had been injured. He
was greatly surprised to see his palsied arm move vigorously.</p>

<p>A milk isolation treatment in bed behind screens was
adopted, whereat the patient was angry, looking upon the
Weir-Mitchell treatment as punishment.</p>

<p>On the next day, another electrical application secured
complete power in the arm and abolished sensory disturbance.
Three days later the man went back to full duty. According
to Fergus Hewat, someone doubtless had suggested to this
patient that he had received a nerve injury. He had become
obsessed thereby and developed a typical functional
paralysis. This was a “cortical misinterpretation,” which
disappeared upon forcible demonstration of the error.</p>

applications of ice.</p>

<p>June, 1915, he started on a three-months convalescent leave
in Paris.</p>

<p>From October to December, he had electric treatment at
the Grand-Palais.</p>

<p>December, 1915, he went to the Salpêtrière under P. Marie,
where he was given electric treatment.</p>

<p>January 1916, he went to Maison-Blanche under Laignel-Lavastine,
where he was given electricity 4½ months.</p>

<p>April 4 he went back to his dépôt.</p>

<p>Presented to the invaliding board, May 11, at Decize,
he was sent to the neurological center at Bourges. He was
there given massage and movements. Upon entrance he had
a functional inactivity of the right arm. He should have
been cured a long time before by the therapeutics employed.
He was then sent to Vincent at the neurological center at
Tours for special motor reëducation. Vincent found almost
complete functional incapacity of the right arm, without
atrophy, with normal reactions, no R. D., and normal arterial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_797" id="Page_797">[797]</a></span>
pressure. June 26, 1916, the patient was able to
write, although slowly. He could sign a letter, and could
lift a weight of 10 kilos.</p>

<p>The details of Vincent’s method mentioned under <a href="#case566">Case 566</a>
are pursued, to use his own words, with <i>methodical ruthlessness</i>.
This form of reëducation consists in manoeuvres that
make the patients yield despite themselves. The galvanic
current is used to force a man to react voluntarily or automatically.
See, for example, Claude’s case of a hysterical
brachial monoplegic (<a href="#case574">Case 574</a>) found able to descend a
ladder with the use of his arms only. After the physician’s
victory is secured, then a sort of consolidation must be
obtained by means of the execution of certain movements on
the part of the patient for an hour or two. As another
factor in the situation set up by Clovis Vincent, is the
enthusiasm generated in the moral atmosphere in which the
cure takes place. Mott has also insisted upon this atmosphere
of cure, which Mott believes is in part responsible
for the good results of Adrian and Yealland. Roussy and
Boisseau, at Salins, started out with a process similar to that
of Vincent, with a preliminary period of isolation. Roussy
also uses the faradic current instead of the galvanic (see
remarks of Mann concerning deaths with the Kaufmann
method in Germany, under <a href="#case570">Case 570</a>). Vincent’s three
stages are given in <a href="#chart19">Chart 19, page 897</a>.</p>

<h4><b>Case 575.</b> (<span class="smcap">Binswanger</span>, July, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A German subaltern officer, 27, was wounded September
25, 1914, in a battle in France. He gave the following account:</p>

<p>“We had been firing without interruption four days, and
then were sent back. While going back from cover we were
under shell fire. Three or four horses fell. I got a glancing
blow from a shell fragment in the back of the head, and fell
down. I was not quite unconscious. I tried several times
to get up, but I could not, for I had very bad pains in the
head and a confused feeling in it, too. I remember also that
a wheel ran over my foot, and that I got a sharp blow in the
chest. Then I was unconscious for about an hour. When
I awoke, there were two comrades busy over me and they
pulled me back of the firing-line. Then I got to a field
hospital.”</p>

<p>The man arrived at the nerve hospital (Jena), October 8,
1914, with insomnia, respiratory disturbance, sudden perspiration,
feelings of cold in the right foot, and poor appetite.
He had had nausea for a few days. Lungs and heart proved
normal. X-ray of the right foot showed normal relations.
The man was a small, powerfully-built man, well nourished,
with lively reflexes, especially the knee reflexes, of which the
right was greater than the left; slight patellar clonus, right;
left plantar reflex greater than right; segmental disorder of
touch and pain sense in the right foot and lower leg, a zone
of analgesia lying above the zone of total anesthesia. Gait
was lame on account of inability to move the right ankle
joint. In walking, the right foot was trailed.</p>

<p>Treatment was suggestive and supported by active gymnastic
exercises, breathing exercises, exercises in moving
the right leg, massage, faradism and local hydrotherapy.
The gait gradually improved, the cold feeling disappeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_799" id="Page_799">[799]</a></span>
from the right leg, disturbances of pain and touch sense disappeared.
The patient was released on the 2d of February,
1915, capable of garrison duty.</p>

<p>With respect to this man, who was married, he was from
a healthy family and had healthy children. He is said,
however, to have suffered from convulsions for a long time in
early life, but thereafter had never been sick in any way.
He was a good student and had been a post-office official
since 1908. After two years’ military service, he became, in
1910, <i>Unteroffizier-Aspirant</i>. Later he was advanced to his
subaltern position in the reserve.</p>

<p>This case seems to be a characteristic example of segmental
disorder of sensations of both touch and pain, combined
with a paresis in the same region. Mechanical and
mental factors seem to have been present, and the case
belongs in what Binswanger calls the “hysterosomatic”
group.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> Binswanger’s so-called hysterosomatic group, he defines
the cases as having emotional, mechanical, and toxic
(gas) factors. On the whole, they are best classified as a
kind of psychoneurosis. Binswanger finds all physical and
drug treatment without result except as supportives. He
has used hydrotherapy and electrotherapy with the perfectly
clear conception that the procedures were of suggestive
value only. In fact, Binswanger had before defined
such procedures as <i>Realsuggestionen</i> or material suggestions.
Common verbal suggestion, says Binswanger, will work sometimes
only when aided by these material suggestions. See
also under <a href="#case576">Case 576</a>.</p>

</div>

<h4><b>Case 576.</b> (<span class="smcap">Binswanger</span>, July, 1915.)</h4>

<p>O. F., 26, healthy, of a healthy family, in military service,
1908-1910, a miner in October, 1912, had fallen into a shaft
from a considerable height, and is said to have been unconscious
for three days and two nights and to have had some
sort of attack a short time after waking. Later he had
another attack, beginning with violent headaches, running
from the back to the fore part of the head, then dizziness,
then a fall with unconsciousness. The whole attack lasted
about four minutes and was followed by feelings of extreme
fatigue.</p>

<p>It seems that in the spring of 1913 these attacks had begun
to repeat themselves two or three times a week. In the
spring of 1914 there had again been two attacks at an interval
of two weeks. They had occurred on the way to work and
had been introduced by the same symptoms as before. They
lasted about half an hour.</p>

<p>He was in the war in France from August 6, 1914. While
he was cooking, one day, in the middle of September, he had
an attack and this without special occasion. The next attack
occurred a little while afterwards, at the time of an
assault. He said that he fell down and lost his senses. When
he came to his senses again, he found he could not move his
legs.</p>

<p>He was taken to a reserve hospital in Germany, and while
there had several attacks with unconsciousness and spasmodic
convulsions&mdash;the last on December 7, 1914. He was
transferred to the Jena Hospital on the 11th.</p>

<p>The Jena examination had the benefit of an inquiry concerning
the case. It seems that he had left the field hospital
in the enemy’s country, in a half-conscious condition,
and rode away therefrom aimlessly. It was only in Germany<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_801" id="Page_801">[801]</a></span>
that he, on his own story, found his bearings again.
However, upon admission the disturbance in walking was very
noticeable, since the patient came hobbling through the
garden of the clinic with the upper part of his body bent
forward, and with the support of two canes. The legs were
moved with difficulty; he seemed to take short, tripping
steps, with the toes dragging on the ground. His inability
to walk he explained through the violent pains which he
would feel in the joints of the legs and an extraordinary
weakness in his legs.</p>

<p>Physically, the man was a tall, strongly built and well-nourished
subject. Neurologically, the knee-jerks were somewhat
decreased and weaker on the right side than on the left;
the Achilles reflexes were lively. The plantar reflex was not
obtainable on the left side; decreased on the right. The
abdominal reflexes were absent on both sides.</p>

<p>Most remarkable was the general diminution in sensitiveness
of the skin to touch and pain, involving the whole
body, up to the neck, where the sensory impairment abruptly
ceased in a sharp line. The anesthesia was not everywhere
complete. In a few places pencil strokes were successfully
localized and recognized. Deep pin-pricks were everywhere
recognized as itching. When the trunk was everywhere
examined on both sides symmetrically, a strong pressure with
a pin-head was felt as a strong pressure on the right side, but
was felt not at all on the left side. Anesthesia and analgesia
were total in the legs. Deep folds of skin could be punctured
by needles without reaction.</p>

<p>The legs could be moved freely upon urgent request with
the patient in dorsal decubitus. Still these movements were
slow and difficult, as explained by the patient, on account of
violent pains in the joints. If put on his feet, he would begin
to sway greatly and permit himself to slide down to the ground,
stating that he was quite incapable of standing or walking
without aid. With two canes, however, he could move freely
about in the ward and in the garden, and even with considerable
speed, in a peculiar, dragging, shuffling way; in the
execution he gave no sign of pain, contentedly smoking a
cigar or a pipe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_802" id="Page_802">[802]</a></span></p>

<p>While his status was being taken on admission, he became
suddenly dull and irresponsive, with a staring look. He
could not state his age or his birthplace. However, he became
clear shortly, upon urging, and explained the spell by
saying that the blood had risen to his head. A few days later,
he was transferred to the psychiatric division. He was
given strict rest in bed, smoking was forbidden, prolonged
baths were used, and the legs were massaged. He felt very
comfortable in the prolonged baths and could then move his
legs without pain.</p>

<p>A few days later he was taken out of bed several times a
day, the canes being removed immediately, and he was led
about the day-room with the light support of two nurses.
Being promised a cigar as a reward, he proved able to walk
through the day-room supported by but one nurse. A week
later the pains in walking exercises had disappeared. He had
become able to walk alone, supporting himself lightly along
the wall with one hand. Walking was still uncertain and slow.</p>

<p>December 20, the patient could stand free without support,
swaying slightly; improvement became rapid. He
could shortly stand and walk without support though his
walk was still awkward and on a wide base with knees pressed
in and body bent forward, soles were kept applied to the
ground. December 22, the patient could walk in the garden
without aid.</p>

<p>December 23, there was a spell of great weariness and
complaint of being sick. The patient lay down on the bed,
cried aloud, and had rhythmic twitchings and sudden movements
with arms and legs. He scratched the right half of his
face with his right hand. This spell lasted about a minute.
It was repeated in the same way twice within the half hour.</p>

<p>He had complete amnesia for these attacks. The pupillary
reactions were entirely normal in the attacks. He had
been in bad spirits that day because a Christmas furlough
had been refused. The attacks provoked no bad consequences
and his gait improved. He was on furlough from
the 30th to January 3; on the 4th he was transferred to the
nerve department, but on the 12th of January he was reprimanded
for a breach of discipline, whereupon at 9:15 he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_803" id="Page_803">[803]</a></span>
an hysterical attack with the same coördinate rhythmic
motions as before. This attack lasted about 20 minutes.
Two hours before the attack he had complained of weariness
and a boiling-hot feeling in the body. Long walks were
taken. On February 15 he began to feel very happy. He
was informed that the charge against him for leaving his
troop had been dropped. He complained of sudden weariness
and headache and was markedly depressed, but he had no
hysterical attack.</p>

<p>After February 23 he took part regularly in gymnastics,
executing the movements with joy and without special weariness.
He wanted to be discharged. He was discharged as
fit for garrison duty and he has since gone back to field service.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> gymnastics, Binswanger holds that they have a special
value in overcoming inner psychic resistances and weak-willed
persons. The <i>Realsuggestionen</i> (see under preceding
case, 575), such as hydrotherapy and electrotherapy, serve
to concentrate the person’s attention on certain regions.
These regional suggestions then smooth the way for the
curative suggestion, namely, the constant and monotonously
repeated assurance that recovery is advancing. At the next
stage, according to Binswanger, gymnastic exercises may be
brought in to overcome hopelessness, indifference, or exaggeration
of morbid feelings. Binswanger sets methodical
tasks for the attention and the will (a so-called <i>Uebungstherapie</i>).
If these gymnastics lead to manifest improvement,
then a proper educational therapy is prescribed, which
is no longer a merely exercise therapy, but consists of
actions of actual value in hospital routine. The convalescents
are gradually led to carry on housework, food service,
gardening (the latter under supervision). Hospital clerical
work is a suitable occupation. <i>Re</i> supervision over gardening,
mentioned by Binswanger, Canadian experience indicates
that the idea of supervision may be greatly extended.
Particularly is this true in vocational reëducation. Kidner
describes the functions of a vocational counsellor, who has
to have an expert knowledge of industry and methods of
industrial training, as well as an acquaintance with the varying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_804" id="Page_804">[804]</a></span>
demands for workers, a knowledge of the seasonal variations
in employment, and a knowledge of occupational diseases.
<i>Re</i> occupational therapy, Todd estimates that from
0.5 to 1 per cent of wounded men in France will require
vocational reëducation. Occupational therapy is the proper
vestibule to vocational training. He lists the following
forms of treatment used in institutions for vocational reëducation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Active mechanotherapy.</li>
<li>Passive mechanotherapy.</li>
<li>Galvanic, static, and faradic electricity.</li>
<li>Vibration.</li>
<li>Hot air baths and blasts.</li>
<li>Water baths.</li>
<li>Colored light.</li>
<li>Massage.</li>
<li>Gymnastics.</li>
</ul>

<p>Central specialized institutions such as those developed
in France are necessary, and such centres should be large
rather than small, according to Todd, and should contain
not less than 200 beds. Todd insists that work is, after
all, the most important measure of reëducation; and Turner,
speaking of the home for neurasthenics at Golders Green,
says that during a period of three months (the number of
the patients is limited to 100, and three months is the limit
of stay), the vast majority, even of the most obstinate
cases, get well through the effects of sympathy and insistance
upon work. Near Golders Green is the Maida Vale
Hospital for nervous cases, so that in case of need the physicians
there may treat the patients. Salmon gives a list
of the occupations which are suitable for these cases.</p>

<p>Blown up by shell; wounds, right side, distention

of hip; later rectal and bladder incontinence.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 577.</b> (<span class="smcap">Binswanger</span>, July, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A Russian from the Ukraine was received at the nerve
hospital, Jena, December 12, 1914. Through an interpreter
it was established that he was a peasant, had been under
shell fire in a skirmish at the beginning of November, and
had been hurled (so he said) 1¼ meters into the air without
loss of consciousness. There was a wound of the right
shoulder and also, he thought, of the legs, from the air pressure.
Becoming a German prisoner, he had been treated in
various hospitals.</p>

<p>He was a strong man of medium height, with a healthy
complexion. There were two healed wounds of the right
shoulder, and near the twelfth spinous process a third similar
scar. There were a number of ulcers and furuncles over the
os sacrum.</p>

<p>Neurologically, the knee-jerks and Achilles jerks could not
be obtained, and the plantar reflex, extinct on the left, was
weak on the right. Sensitiveness to pain on both sides was
lost from the knee downwards but there was hyperalgesia in
the thigh. Inaccurate statements in response to tactile tests
were made, apparently on account of lack of understanding.
In lying down, there was a slight restriction in the movements
of the legs, and active movements of the joints of the
foot on the right side were impossible. Gait was ataxic-paretic,
more markedly so right than left. He could walk
only with two canes, and during walking the musculature of
the thigh fell into a spastic tension. The tongue deviated
to the left. There were severe rheumatic pains in the thighs.</p>

<p>It appears that some weeks before, this Russian soldier
had suffered from severe rheumatic pains in both sides and
was at that time absolutely unable to walk or stand. At
that time, however, there was no question of a crural paraplegia
of organic origin, since the man could move his legs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_806" id="Page_806">[806]</a></span>
well enough when in dorsal decubitus. There were no signs
of paralysis of the rectum or bladder at that time.</p>

<p>Treatment at Jena consisted in regular walking exercises
with support at the shoulders. The lower legs and feet remained
weak and paretic. The decubital ulcers disappeared.</p>

<p>About the middle of December rectal incontinence began,
the stool being discharged without the patient’s noticing it
while being led to the bath. Later there was incontinence
of feces in bed. Pains in the legs were constantly complained
of. Nevertheless improvement in walking was maintained.
The toes were dragged at every step and the knee-joints
were thrown outward in walking. The musculature of
the lower legs was weak. Knee-jerks could not be elicited
more than before. He constantly complained of pains in the
knees and right hip. The rectal disorder did not again
occur during January.</p>

<p>Toward the close of January, the patient’s right lower leg
and left foot would occasionally feel asleep; both legs felt
cold and itched. In a general way, however, the pains had
become less marked than they were at first. It seemed that
he had no sensations at stool, and consequently had to resort
to the closet at a definite time. Moreover, urine was
discharged irregularly and involuntarily when he coughed.
It appears that a few days after receiving his wounds in
battle, there had been pains on micturition as well as blood
in the urine, and it appears that he had been catheterized.
It is probable that he had suffered from distention, as he
described his abdomen, thighs and sex organs as swollen.</p>

<p>In February he began to be able to move alone with two
canes through the ward, but he moved his legs from the
knee downward very little, and dragged them after the rest
of the body. Upon galvanic examination, the peroneal and
tibial nerve trunks were found normally excitable. At this
time the sensibility situation had changed somewhat, since
complete analgesia was present only in the foot, and hypalgesia
had developed upon the anterior surfaces of the lower
legs. Pin-pricks were described as touches. The posterior
surface of the left lower leg was normally sensitive. There
was an oblong stripe about 3 cm. long, beginning in the popliteal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_807" id="Page_807">[807]</a></span>
space and stretching downward on the left side. The
right lower leg was entirely insensitive. The posterior surfaces
of both thighs as far as the gluteal folds were completely
insensible to pain. The Wassermann reaction of the
blood was negative. In this condition the patient was transferred
to a prison camp hospital.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> bloody urine, see <a href="#B_SHELL-SHOCK_NATURE_AND_CAUSES">Section B</a>, <a href="#case202">Case 202</a>. <i>Re</i> rectal incontinence,
it might be inquired whether this was possibly
functional. Roussy and Lhermitte devote a chapter to visceral
disorders. They do not list rectal incontinence amongst
the disorders noted in this war, nor have any cases of hysterical
anorexia or disorders of sensation in the intestinal
tract been seen during the war despite the occurrence of
these latter disorders in the civilian group. The main digestive
disorder that the war cases show is vomiting (see
Cases <a href="#case495">495</a> and <a href="#case500">500</a>).</p>

<p>Emotionality: Shell explosion; mutism. Recovery
by reëducation.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 578.</b> (<span class="smcap">Briand</span> and <span class="smcap">Philippe</span>, September, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A plumber, 27, went into the infantry. He was very
emotional and was but a short time in the trenches when the
explosion of shells threw him into a state of mutism. Deafness,
rather curiously, did not manifest itself for several
days. He had to go back on horseback, and, as he was a
poor horseman, slipped off the horse, giving himself a bad
fright. When he got up, he had lost his hearing.</p>

<p>He was sent to several hospitals and finally to Val-de-Grâce,
in July, 1915. He recovered hearing in fifteen days,
but the mutism persisted several months. According to
Briand and Philippe, this is a typical case, except for the
duration of the mutism. The first treatment was given this
patient August 6. His respiration was examined and tracing
was taken. August 15, on the morning visit, he was found
able to whistle very distinctly the first bars of “Au Clair de
la Lune,” and then began to sing the first verses, articulating
distinctly, but stammering a little. He was now left to his
own resources, without special exercises, from August 15 to
September 26, and completely lost the benefit of his previous
exercises. A week of special treatment allowed him to recover
speech again, enough to take up every day life. The
patient went out well.</p>

<p>The general lines of the examination in this case took up
attitude in abdominal respiration and the question of respiratory
pauses, especially pauses in abdominal respiration,
which, in the above case, were exaggerated. Expiration
was deficient and disordered. The normal adaptations that
had been established during his childhood learning of speech
had failed, and the patient would not have been able by
himself to regain proper balance of respiration for speech.</p>

<p>The examination was continued to learn the difficulties of
innervation of the muscles of phonation whose proper delicacy
had been lost. Such a patient is a kind of bad gymnast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_809" id="Page_809">[809]</a></span>
executing an exercise known to be hard by contracting
all the muscles of the region, both the antagonist and the
agonist muscles. Reëducation must, therefore, endeavor to
sweep away the contractions that block sound. Then the
patient must be made to perform the contractions necessary
in phonation and articulation unconsciously. The methods
used for teaching children might here be employed, but
more elaborate and designed methods can be used with the
adult, <i>e.g.,</i></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. Breathing exercises, especially with the idea of making
respiration complete.</p>

<p>2. Blowing exercises.</p>

<p>3. Whistling.</p>

<p>4. Vowel sounding.</p>

</div>

<p>Séguin and Rouma, on the other hand, counsel beginning
exercises with consonants in stammerers and dyslalics.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> tests for functional deafness, Ranjard states that on
account of the complexity of Shell-shock deafness, exact
diagnosis needs to be made. Examination of the hearing
by speech alone, or by the watch-tick, yielded poor results;
and an accurate mathematical acoumeter (<i>Sirène à voyelles</i>,
Marage) is recommended. See especially chapter on the
functional examination of audition in Bourgeois and Sourdille’s
<i>War Otitis and War Deafness</i>, a work translated and
highly recommended by the English otologist, Dundas

<h4><b>Case 579.</b> (<span class="smcap">Binswanger</span>, July, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A traveling salesman in civil life, 36, as a non-commissioned
officer took part in severe fighting in the East shortly
after the outbreak of the war. He was under violent shell
fire at one time for five hours at a stretch. In the middle
of November, after a skirmish in the woods which had lasted
for three days, he was found unconscious. According to his
own story, he was awakened from this unconsciousness about
a week later in a hospital. He described himself as quite
unable to say anything about what had gone on during that
week.</p>

<p>The medical report on the case stated that he arrived at
the hospital, November 18, in a dormant state of mind. He
had appeared markedly excited and kept incessantly talking
about military matters, such as the placing of machine guns,
the occupation of the edge of the woods by his company,
addressing the nurse as “Captain,” and the sister as “Mrs.
Captain,” making as it were an official report to them. He
showed shyness, and always an extreme excitement. His
hands and legs were in constant motion; he complained of
headaches and itching finger-tips. Sleep could be achieved
only by drugs. This mental state lasted till November 26,
when he became oriented. Sleep improved, but he complained
of pains in the back of the head.</p>

<p>Upon transfer to a convalescent home, December 5, he
was still occasionally excited and sometimes sleepless. On
December 30, the patient began to stammer; his speech had
before this been somewhat difficult, but the stammering began
suddenly; speech was indistinct and slow; syllables
failed to follow one another at like intervals. The headache
at this time radiated from the middle of the top of the
head to the side of the neck. There was a complaint of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_811" id="Page_811">[811]</a></span>
vibrating pains on the two sides of the vertebral column, and
a feeling of weakness and unsteadiness in walking. The
patient would sway with eyes closed and turn sidewise. The
heart action was tumultuous, the pulse irregular and uneven.</p>

<p>The patient was transferred back to the reserve hospital
on January 2, 1915, whereupon the stammering became worse,
sleep restless, and arms and legs subject to spasmodic pains
and twitching. On January 25, he was removed to the Jena
Hospital. He remarked that at the convalescent home he
became very much excited at the Christmas celebration and
had to cry, whereupon his speech became more and more
difficult; he could not find the beginnings of words and had
to stammer. Upon admission he also complained of sharp
pains in the soles of the feet and in the finger-tips.</p>

<p>Neurologically, there was marked dermatographia, the
deep reflexes were increased, abdominal reflexes were absent;
there were points of pain on pressure in both supra-orbital
regions, and there was a general hypalgesia with the exception
of the head, the lower legs, the feet, the scrotum, the
penis and the anal region. Pin-pricks were recognized on
the right side only, when the patient was tested bilaterally.
They could be recognized on both sides when the patient was
examined on one side at a time. There was a static tremor
on both sides (?). He could move his arms, but in dorsal
decubitus he could move his legs only jerkily and uncertainly.
His gait was waddling with dragging of toes.</p>

<p>There was a marked photophobia. The palatal and swallowing
reflexes were in excess; speech was hesitant and
stammering. The first letters of words, especially initial
consonants, could be pronounced with difficulty, explosively
with cheeks blown up, after several attempts. The consonant
would be repeated several times before the vowel could be
added. The patient’s name was Singer, and he would pronounce
it: <i>S … S … S … Si … n … n … ger</i>;
the last syllable (<i>ger</i>) being brought out with a strong accentuation.
The whole process took five seconds. The word
<i>Flanelllatten</i> took 14 seconds. It seems that the patient had
already suffered (in 1907) from nasal catarrh and disturbance
of hearing from stoppage of the Eustachian tubes. Another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_812" id="Page_812">[812]</a></span>
attack in 1908 had been accompanied by an irritating cough,
and there seems to have been catarrh on the right in 1913,
as well as cerumen on the left side.</p>

<p>Treatment: The patient was isolated; in the next few
days there was improvement in the headache. The patient
complained of muscular twitchings, which would occur suddenly
in different parts of the body. On February 1 there
was a subjective feeling of happiness since all pains had disappeared.</p>

<p>The patient was given regular exercises in speaking and
there was gradual improvement in speech. Body-weight increased,
regular walks were taken, and the patient occupied
himself with garden work.</p>

<p>By June, 1915, he had still further remarkably improved,
working now all day long, partly in the garden, partly in the
hospital office. Disturbance of speech was not noticed except
for hesitation before the last syllables of long words during
comparatively long conversations. All trace of difficulty
in walking had disappeared. In this patient no hereditary
taint could be proved. He appears to have been of normal
development, serving in the army from 1901 to 1903. In his
life as a traveling salesman, there was frequently catarrh of
the throat, and in 1912 there was a marked swelling of the
vocal cords with extreme hoarseness and inability to speak,
which condition was cured after local treatment.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> hysterical speech and voice disorders, Binswanger has
found them amongst the most obstinate conditions, often
persisting when all other hysterical phenomena have dropped
away. He states that apparently the cure of some of these
cases must be postponed until the end of the war.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> general results of the therapeutic treatment of the war
hysterias, Binswanger states that he has been able to send
some cases back to the front that have successfully stayed
there. He has had failures, however, even amongst men
who have had no <i>mauvaise volonté</i> and have themselves
desired to be sent back to the front.</p>

<p>Gordon Wilson observed 250 cases of Shell-shock at the
Ypres salient and on the Somme. Fifty of these cases
complained of deafness, and 17 of the 50 were found to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_813" id="Page_813">[813]</a></span>
actual nerve deafness. Wilson treated “fixed idea” cases
by hypnotism, and sometimes by cold water run into the
ear. He, in general, divides the cases in to (<i>a</i>) cases of
nerve deafness, (<i>b</i>) fixed idea cases, and (<i>c</i>) malingerers.</p>

<p>Marage states that frequent exposure to the noise of
shells for long periods may produce a permanent deafness,
as has long been known in naval gun-makers and boiler-makers
in peace times. He advocates obturators, a good
form being plasticine wrapped in gauze moulded to the
shape of the internal meatus. Celluloid plugs, sometimes
used, have been known to be set afire by the flash of a shell.
Cerumen sometimes protects against deafness, but Mott
speaks of the driving of the wax into the tympanum as a
dangerous effect in certain shock cases.</p>

<p>BURIAL by shell explosion: DEAFMUTISM.
Treatment: phonetic reëducation.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 580.</b> (<span class="smcap">Liébault</span>, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A machine gunner, 26, was buried at Rheims, January 5,
1915, by the explosion of a large shell bursting over the
dugout. He was unconscious three days and deafmute on
coming to, without amnesia but with a feeling of constriction
in the throat.</p>

<p>After fifteen days in the ambulance he was sent for four
months to the Maritime Hospital at Brest, and treated by
hypnotism. Seven or eight sittings had no other result than
to fatigue him. There were then three months of convalescence.
Returned to Vannes, September 20, 1915, he was
put into the auxiliaries. As he could not work much he
was sent, December, 1915, to the Hôtel-Dieu at Nantes.
Here electric vibratory massage was given, which secured a
few hoarse sounds.</p>

<p>Phonetic reëducation was then undertaken at Prés-à-goutrière,
May 10, and his respiratory capacity increased
from 170 the first week to 250 and 300 the following weeks.
His blowing strength was raised from 15 to 20 to 25 at the
same time. In a few weeks he was much improved and
June 27 passed on to his auditory reëducation. The respiratory
capacity in this man was insufficient. He could
not speak, but his respiratory movements were good and he
learned again to speak in a voice as good as ever.</p>

<p>According to Liébault, it is a general principle that, if
the respiratory capacity is increased, the voice will clear or
become better; but, if the respiratory capacity remains
stationary, the voice will not improve. It is the same with
normal persons. A subject with a very subnormal respiratory
capacity cannot speak loudly, but, if his respiratory
capacity approaches normal, he can speak normally. According
to Liébault, all cases of this sort have had some
respiratory anomaly and each case must be systematically
examined with the aid of anthropometric tables, including<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_815" id="Page_815">[815]</a></span>
weight, height and chest capacity. The vocal disorder is
proportionate to the degree of functioning of the phonating
apparatus taken as a whole. It is not merely that the
larynx should be examined, but the motor side of the apparatus,
the respiratory muscles, the resonating apparatus, the
lips, the mouth, the nasal fossæ and the pharynx.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> curability of different types of war deafmute, Roussy
and Boisseau maintain that the type (<i>a</i>) that comes gesticulating,
pointing to the ears, and desirous of writing, is
the type that responds most rapidly to psychotherapy.
There are two other types less responsive: (<i>b</i>) is an apathetic
type, with impassive and stupid facies, lies immobile
in bed, or sits in a chair in mental confusion; type (<i>c</i>) shows
a facies of terror, looks haggard and anxious, confused, disoriented,
and possibly delirious.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> general treatment of deaf cases, Zange suggests that
emotion should not be aroused by intense auditory impressions,
that he should not be reminded of his shock, and
should be kept as cheerful as possible. Zange states that
he found the static electric current of service, and got good
results in hysterical deafness of sudden development by
applying a strong faradic current.</p>

<p>A year’s service; leave: Hysterical aphonia developed
at home. Respiratory gymnastics.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 581.</b> (<span class="smcap">Garel</span>, April, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A soldier, 35, went on leave August, 1915. Arriving at his
farm, he had a violent feeling of moral perturbation and suddenly
lost his voice. When he returned from leave he
seemed stupid, spoke very few words and seemed to look
about in a vague and undecided way. He was several
months in this state and sent January, 1916, to Saint-Luc.</p>

<p>The vocal cords were there found of a normal color and
without paralysis. “It was, therefore,” remarks Garel, “a
nervous aphonia susceptible of instantaneous cure.” The
patient was made to make a sound in the lowest tone possible.
While he was making this attempt, sharp pressure
was exerted upon the lower part of the sternum, to provoke
expiratory reinforcement. The sound emitted was loud, to
the great astonishment of the patient, who, thus aided by
suggestion, shortly began to talk aloud.</p>

<p>In this particular patient a temporary return of voice was
readily obtained, but not maintained. Special exercises had
to be instituted, whereupon the patient immediately fell
back into a complete aphonia. He was then made to scan
words, syllable by syllable, executing with his arms classical
movements of respiratory gymnastics, or sometimes with
the utterance of every syllable the epigastrium was manually
compressed or the shoulders suddenly lowered. The patient
could now read a book in a jerky manner, and after a few
lines he could read without his shoulders being pressed.</p>

<p>Another plan was to have the man read or talk while
walking. As soon as he was stopped and accosted, however,
he lost his voice again. Up to the time of report it was
impossible to secure a definite return of voice, as the patient
was not willing to associate words with peculiar movements.
It might make him ridiculous. Accordingly, the nurses were
requested not to fulfil requests unless they were made aloud.
Recovery was to be hoped for from this measure.</p>

<p>Wounded: Recurrent stammering: Reëducation.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 582.</b> (<span class="smcap">MacMahon</span>, August, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A young English officer, previously cured of stammering
while a boy, fell to stammering again after being twice
wounded. The impediment was of the laryngeal type.
When spoken to he was often quite speechless. In Shell-shock
stammering, the chief difficulty according to MacMahon
is in the production of voice consonants and vowel
sounds. In mild cases the trouble is best left alone.</p>

<p>This officer was anxious to pass into the regular army from
the reserve to which he was attached. The stammering
prevented this. He was treated nine months and improved
rapidly. He passed through the trying ordeal of the medical
board successfully and went to his regiment.</p>

<p>In severe cases the patient is taught how to fill his lungs
properly. He is taught to acquire an inferior lateral costal
expansion in inspiration. During expiration the abdominal
muscles are trained to contract slowly and strongly, pressing
the diaphragm upwards and drawing the lower ribs downwards
and inwards. This steady breathing produces a sensation
of repose in the stammerer. He is not to raise the
upper chest and not to tense the throat, tongue or jaws.</p>

<p>The main vowel sounds are now taught. The main vowel
sounds are oo, oh, au, ah, a and ee. They combine in six ways,
oh and oo in the word wound, ah and ee make the long i,
au and ee in boy, oh and oo in road, a and ee in rain and fair,
ee and oo in new and you. There are also words in which
no main vowel or compound sounds appear, which may be
placed either on the open ah position or the closed ee position.
Such words as long, abbot, among, which are on the position
of ah and such words as it, sister, minister which are in the
position of ee. The voice consonants are b, d, g, j, l, m, n, r,
v, w, y, z, w being oo sound and y the ee sound. The
breathed consonants are c, f, h, k, p, q, s, t.</p>

<p>The treatment of stammering intensified by Shell-shock

<p>An officer was wounded under his left eye, October 7, 1916.
His speech was affected only five days later in a casualty
clearing station. Observed by MacMahon, November 5, he
was found to speak with great difficulty and became exhausted
after a few words. He was tensing all the muscles
in attempting to speak. Breathing advice was given and
counsel how to relax in the abnormal efforts.</p>

am getting a bit better. I feel I must keep quiet, and it
comes after a bit. I think far quicker than I speak.” He
said that the breathing exercises had helped him most.</p>

<p>November 15, he still spoke in a rather staccato way; but
the words did not check as they had. In a week further
there had been so much improvement that he was discharged

<p>Shell wound and burial: Camptocormia (psychoelectric

lameness (long reëducative treatment successful).</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 584.</b> (<span class="smcap">Roussy</span> and <span class="smcap">Lhermitte</span>, 1917.)</h4>

<p>At a Neuropsychiatric Center, September 2, 1916, arrived
a chasseur, 29, showing lameness of a pseudocoxalgic type on
the left side, combined with an anterior camptocormia. The
whole situation had lasted a year. The chasseur had been
wounded by shell explosion on the left side and was buried
on July 29, 1915. He lost consciousness and had respiratory
trouble and mutism. His arched walk and lameness
began August 20, 1915.</p>

<p>He had a number of terms in hospital and six months at
the dépôt. He was sent back to the front, June 20, 1916,
being proposed for auxiliary work. There was some mental
weakness. After one séance of electric treatment, the improper
attitude of the trunk was corrected. The lameness,
however, persisted and required long daily reëducation.</p>

<p>The patient was discharged cured, October 20, 1916, without
lameness or camptocormia. There were a few persistent
lumbar pains.</p>

<p><i>Re</i> treatment of war psychoneuroses, Roussy and Lhermitte
recommend rational and persuasive psychotherapy
after the manner of Dejerine, Dubois, Babinski, and others.
Hypnosis, they say, should definitely be rejected. Mental
contagion must be staved off, and Roussy and Lhermitte
believe that almost all cases are curable and should be sent
back as competents.</p>

<p>They maintain that the medical officer himself plays the
leading part. Many patients are “cured” when they find
“good masters”; this mastery of the combined confessor
and educator is greatly aided by prestige. He must speak
with authority, with “iron in the velvet glove”; but with
patience and persistence. If a long sitting fails, postpone
work on the pretext of resting the patient. The patient
must not be early threatened with discipline. Even exaggerators<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_820" id="Page_820">[820]</a></span>
and malingerers must be talked to as if neuropathic.</p>

<p>A careful medical examination, besides correcting false
diagnoses and demonstrating hystero-organic associations, will
give the patient confidence in his physician.</p>

<p>A new patient is more easily cured than an old one. In
general, patients should be treated as soon as possible after
the shock. Contractures are habitually more persistent
than paralysis; tremors and tic are more pertinacious than
deafmutism; ante-bellum psychoneuroses are less easy to
treat than cases developed by the war alone.</p>

<p>The neurological centers near the front, with their discipline,
inaccessibility to friends, and nearness to the front,
present a situation which yields easier and quicker cures
than the interior; but after the two-years’ experience which
proved this fact, according to Roussy and Lhermitte, many
cases still get sent back into the interior for many months,&mdash;cases
that ought to be cured near the front. Cases having
convulsive attacks get confinement in separate rooms;
chronic neuropaths are kept in bed on a milk diet.</p>

<p>The general features of the treatment of psychoneuroses
commended by Roussy and Lhermitte are summed up in
what they call the psychoelectric and reëducative method,
divided into four stages: A stage (<i>a</i>) of persuasive conversation;
(<i>b</i>) isolation; (<i>c</i>) faradization; and (<i>d</i>) physical and
psychical reëducation. Roussy and Lhermitte got during
six months in one of the army neurological centers, 98 to 99
per cent of recoveries. Clovis Vincent, in a special interior
hospital (see for Clovis Vincent’s treatment, a summary
under <a href="#case575">Case 575</a>). <i>Re</i> the first stage of persuasive conversations,
Roussy and Lhermitte discuss on the day of admission
the general nature of the patient’s condition, and place him
in the atmosphere of cure, in contact with recovered patients.
The conversation takes place in the physician’s consulting
room. The patient is gotten to promise on oath that he
will submit to any methods of treatment. Although one
may pass from the first stage to the third or electrical stage,
forthwith, Roussy and Lhermitte recommend several days of
isolation. The patient is placed in a separate room, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_821" id="Page_821">[821]</a></span>
kept in bed on a milk diet. This isolation treatment of
Weir Mitchell allows reinforcement of the suggestion by
talks on the medical rounds, allows the patient, perhaps, to
beg for the electrical treatment, which he may have refused
at first, and lengthens the period of observation. According
to Roussy and Lhermitte, spontaneous recovery not infrequently
takes place during this phase of isolation. Lameness
of long standing, tremors, and deafmutism disappear.</p>

<p>The third stage is that of faradization, executed by the
physician with only such attendants as may be necessary
to support the patient. At first, the man lies nude upon
the bed, but later may be treated while sitting, standing,
walking, or running. Feeble currents are used at first;
later stronger ones. The poles are applied to the affected
parts, and sometimes to especially sensitive parts of the
skin, such as the ears, neck, lips, soles, perineum, and scrotum.
Energetic treatment by the rapid method is indicated
in the vast majority of cases, especially at the front.
If a case is seen early, the rapid energetic treatment almost
always cures at once. The success of the method depends
upon the production of a crisis, which ought to be produced
at the first sitting. Sometimes this sitting has to be continued
for hours. Some patients require two or three sittings;
some, still more. Instead of faradism, a cold jet of
water, or even painful subcutaneous injections of ether, may
be used.</p>

<p>The fourth stage is that of physical and psychical reëducation,
important in long-standing cases. The various
forms of physiotherapy are carried out by special assistants
or head nurses, accompanied by psychotherapy, and if necessary
by electricity. According to Roussy and Lhermitte,
these reëducative methods used alone, without previous
faradic treatment, are not successful. Relapse follows
premature transference from the front to hospitals in the
interior, and too early sick leave.</p>

<h4><b>Case 585.</b> (<span class="smcap">Liébault</span>, October, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A corporal, 20, was exposed to the shock of an aerial
torpedo, January 18, 1916, at Souchez. The torpedo fell a
meter away. There was no loss of consciousness, but the
patient was agitated for several hours, not knowing what he
was doing. Evacuated to hospital, he remained several
days in a stupid state. He was completely deaf and remembered
poorly what had happened. He made every effort to
speak, but could not. His head felt on fire. He could not
open his mouth well and his lower jaw was almost in a state
of contracture. He felt that his tongue could not move
easily. In this status he remained until February, always
trying to talk, but not succeeding.</p>

<p>He then arrived at Hôtel-Dieu. The mouth was now
opening better and he was in a better general status, though
always feeling fatigued. Vibratory massage was given to
the laryngeal region. He was gradually got to emit a few
sounds in a low voice. He was sent, April 26, to Prés-à-goutrière.
He was now somewhat vocal, but at times would
become completely aphonic once more. The voice during
the first few weeks of treatment became better, and the
respiratory capacity was increased from 450 the first week to
460 and 500 in the next two weeks.</p>

<p>May 12, he suddenly lost his voice again and wanted to
commit suicide. However, in three more days he was able
to speak normally again and has had no relapse. He was
then put under auditory reëducation and at the time of
report his hearing had slightly improved.</p>

<p>Liébault remarks that during the time when the patient
could not speak his jaw muscles were contracted and his
tongue could not mobilize well. He could think words but
could not articulate them. It was accordingly important to
cultivate the normal functioning of these muscles.</p>

<h4><b>Case 586.</b> (<span class="smcap">MacCurdy</span>, July, 1917.)</h4>

<p>A lieutenant in the Royal Flying Corps, 23, described as
“unusually normal,” a successful business man, athletic,
socially popular, had been for a year in the Infantry. He
was caught suddenly in a gas attack, and, though he recovered
after a few days in bed, had a severe tracheitis and
laryngitis. The lieutenant had been very proud of his voice
and its carrying power. He went to a laryngologist in London,
who said that he would never be able to sing again&mdash;a
matter of some worry.</p>

<p>He soon became an expert airman. In the spring of 1917
he was shot at by antiaircraft guns in a trip over the enemy’s
lines. One of the wings was hit and so weakened that in
landing the lieutenant crashed to the ground. He was unconscious
for three hours and on coming to tried to shout to
his servant in the distance, who, on arrival, found the lieutenant
quite unable to speak.</p>

<p>According to MacCurdy, there was here a conversion hysteria
with regression to the tracheitis that followed the gassing.
The mutism MacCurdy regards as a pathological degree
of an effort of protection for his voice. In hospital
three weeks later he learned to whisper a few words, though
with great mental effort. He regained the voiced sounds by
coughing and then saying “ah.” Stammering now developed.
Not more than one or two words could be said at a
breath. Training to say two, three, four and then five letters
in one expiration yielded improvement in the stammering.
Under mild hypnosis, to the degree merely of distraction,
normal speech was re-attained. There was no relapse.
Singing was then practiced and in a period of six weeks the
singing voice was virtually as good as it ever had been.</p>

</div>

<h4><b>Case 587.</b> (<span class="smcap">Binswanger</span>, July, 1915.)</h4>

<p>A German youth of 19 volunteered at the outset of the
war as a motor cycle rider. About the end of October, he was
hurled from his wheel by a shell which struck close beside
him and exploded, knocking his back against a pile of beams.
He lost consciousness. There may have been hemorrhage.</p>

<p>He came to, two hours later, in the dressing station, hardly
able to move his limbs. Such movements as he could make
were painful. There was an evident contusion of the back.
He had a fainting fit after his bath in the field hospital and
then could get to bed only with support. Severe pains in the
legs, especially in the knee.</p>

<p>In the reserve hospital, there was a second similar fainting
spell, followed by buzzing in the head, feelings of pressure in
the chest and an irregular pulse; all of which phenomena
disappeared the morning after the fit.</p>

<p>A careful examination about the middle of November
showed the persistence of a severe paresis of the left arm,
and a less marked motor weakness of the right arm. Both
legs were paretic, and there were no spontaneous movements
of the leg. This paresis of the legs was combined with
complete anesthesia and analgesia. Sensory impairment
was found only in the right arm and trunk, and there
was no evidence of sensory impairment in the left arm.
Both motor and sensory disturbances of the arm disappeared
rapidly.</p>

<p>However, at the beginning of December, 1914, the complete
insensibility of the lower extremities up to the groin still
persisted. The anesthesia then began to retreat, so that four
days later, the upper limit of anesthesia was somewhat below
the groin. There could be found a circumscribed area
of anesthetic skin over the os sacrum up as far as the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_825" id="Page_825">[825]</a></span>
vertebra of the os sacrum; but the skin around this area,
as well as over each tuber ischii, gave normal sensation.</p>

<p>The anesthesia continued to retreat: to the middle of the
thigh at the middle of December; to a level 3 cm. above the
knee-cap at the end of December; to the upper end of the
knee-cap on the right side and the middle of the left knee-cap,
January 1. January 11, the anesthesia had retreated
to a level 10 cm. below both right and left patella. February
8, sensibility in the legs had entirely returned.</p>

<p>While the anesthesia was pursuing this favorable course,
the motor symptoms failed to improve to any marked extent,
although active motion of the legs with the patient in dorsal
decubitus had gradually returned to a limited degree.</p>

was “rheumatism of the left side of the body and dislocation
of the spine.”</p>

<p>The treatment consisted at first of rest in bed and moist
dressings of the legs, but the treatment had to depend greatly
upon the diagnosis. The patient complained of difficult
micturition; yet there were no other positive signs of organic
disease, of spine or cord.</p>

<p>Hysteria was the diagnosis preferred to rheumatism, despite
the fact that examination at the Jena Hospital failed
to show any disorder in pain or tactile sense.</p>

<p>The patient was a rather tall man of slender build, with
a slightly accentuated second pulmonic sound, decidedly
increased tendon reflexes, weak plantar reflexes, and many
points painful on pressure in various parts of the head, over
the spine, and in the sciatic regions. The vertebral sensibility
to pressure was most acute in the region of the third,
fourth, and fifth thoracic vertebrae. There was a marked
dermatographia. There was no other sensory disorder and
no motor disorder of the arms, though the left hand-grasp
was weak. All passive movements could be successfully
carried out with the legs. Upon bending at the hip, there
were subjective feelings of tension in the posterior parts of
the thighs. In active motion there was a marked limitation
in leg movements, which appeared to be executed with great
difficulty with but small excursion and with considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_826" id="Page_826">[826]</a></span>
trembling. The knee-joint could be flexed only when the
sole of the foot had support. The lower leg could not be
extended. The excursion in the joints of the feet and toes
was slight. Muscular strength was in general decreased.
There were no feelings of pain in muscular action but merely
feelings of great effort. Gait was slow, shuffling, unsteady,
hesitating and only possible with support. Fatigue set in
after a few steps. In walking, the legs could hardly be bent
at the knee. The soles of the feet dragged on the ground.
The patient was unable to stand upright, and when placed
upon his feet, anxiously and stiffly clung to some support.
Without support, he fell over backwards. When supported
he could move his legs at the hip and lift the feet from their
base by bending the knee-joints. The patient could not sit
in a chair or in bed except with support; otherwise he would
fall to the right side. In dorsal decubitus he complained of
pain in the loins.</p>

<p>With this hysterical picture, treatment of a psychotherapeutic
nature was carried out. The patient was given
methodical exercises in walking and standing, during which
affirmative suggestions about his new capacity to walk and
stand were given with monotonous repetition.</p>

<p>For the first fortnight he walked with the support of two
nurses for a half hour every day. He was very industrious
and willing to execute this treatment; and later began to
exercise with a cane. Two days later, he omitted the cane
and found himself able to walk about without support. He
was shortly able to stand without swaying, although for
some time the walk was upon a rather wide base and somewhat
slow and suggestive of spastic paresis.</p>

<p>The general condition of this patient remained good. His
appetite and sleep were good. After the middle of March,
1915, there were no more peculiarities in walking, and the
patient was able to take somewhat long walks in the city
and vicinity. He applied for work in the airship division,
for which he already possessed some experience.</p>

<p>The youth appears to have been of a normal mental and
bodily development, though his mother is said to have been
nervous and a sister died of convulsions in childhood.</p>

<p>Shell-shock with loss of consciousness: Deafmutism,
rhythmic head movements, anesthesia,
asymmetrical areflexia. Recovery by suggestion
with faradism, massage and reëducation.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 588.</b> (<span class="smcap">Arinstein</span>, September, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A Russian private, 30, literate, lost consciousness upon the
explosion of a large shell, November 10, 1915. He was
brought to hospital, November 14, completely deaf and dumb,
and with his head rhythmically swaying sidewise 60 to 70
times per minute. The swaying ceased during sleep. The
head was carried inclined to the right; there was complaint
of headache. The left leg, the trunk and the hairy part of
the head were anesthetic. The knee-jerks were obtained
with difficulty, the Achilles jerks were lively; the throat and
conjunctival reflexes were absent; the abdominal and cremasteric
reflexes were lively. The right plantar reflex was
absent; the left normal. The vision of the right eye was
impaired, and there was a monocular diplopia of this eye.
The drum membranes were pulled in, and the disorder of
hearing was explained on the basis of labyrinthine shock.</p>

<p>After a séance of written suggestion with faradism to neck
and small palate and vibratory massage to throat, speech
returned. November 26, the patient read in a loud voice a
written phrase. He did not speak again independently until
early in December, when he read aloud written matter.
The return of spontaneous speech was gradual. Hearing
returned December 5, when he was able to hear in the right
ear by means of a tube. In the sitting posture there was less
swaying of the head. If the patient lay down, rhythmic
movements of the head became stronger and more rapid (120).</p>

<p>Shell explosion; unconsciousness: Amnesia; paralyses.
Reëducation.</p>
</div>

<h4><b>Case 589.</b> (<span class="smcap">Batten</span>, January, 1916.)</h4>

<p>A corporal in the Belgian army was mobilized when the
war broke out, and was in action continuously in the retreat
from Liège, in the siege of Antwerp, and finally on the Yser
until October 27, 1914, when the explosion of large shells
rendered him unconscious. He recovered consciousness only
in hospital at Calais. Though he was able to see and hear
well, he was dazed and remembered nothing of what had
happened. In fact, he did not understand what was said to
him.</p>

<p>In a week’s time, his memory and intelligence returned,
save for periodic attacks in which he was dazed. From the
very beginning he had been quite unable to move his legs, and
at first the arms were weak. He had a series of attacks of
violent struggling in November and December, 1914, which
the corporal himself called fainting attacks, claiming that
he did not move his legs in the attacks but only his arms.
In fact, he claimed that he could move neither head, body,
nor legs, but only the arms. He said, “Sometimes I try
hard and set my teeth, but I do not know how to move my
head and my legs; I try but they do not move.” Sphincter
control was maintained. Although he could see, when he
attempted to read, everything went black.</p>

<p>He was finally admitted to the National Hospital for the
Paralyzed and Epileptic on July 8, 1915, on the service of
Major Walshe. He was thin and wasted. He was firmly
convinced, according to the notes of Major Walshe, that he
was seriously paralyzed. He said he could not lift his head;
when his body was lifted, his head fell back, or rather perhaps
was definitely thrown back, lolling about alarmingly. However
as he lay in bed he frequently lifted his head unconsciously
and placed his hands under it. When asked to lift
his head, the sternomastoids were strongly contracted, but
at the same time the neck extensors also, so that the head was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_829" id="Page_829">[829]</a></span>
stiffly and strongly held in an extended position. Despite
the patient’s statement that he could not move the trunk
muscles, he could turn over readily in bed, and when trying
to move the head the trunk was fixed in a strong opisthotonos,
and the abdominal walls were rigid. When requested to
move his legs, he made no movement whatever, though
during head movements the legs were strongly fixed in extension.
On passive movements, there was no active muscular
resistance. There was an indefinite blunting of all
kinds of sensations. Reflexes were normal.</p>

<p>Major Walshe worked hard with the patient, inducing him
first to lift his head from the pillow, and finally to move the
legs. In three weeks’ time, the corporal could just sit up,
and at the end of another month, he was able to stand in the
walking machine. At the end of a third month, he was
walking upon crutches, and at the end of another, he could
walk upon two sticks with his feet wide apart, moving as if
glued to the floor. To quote Batten,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_830" id="Page_830">[830]</a></span> “The corporal will
eventually get well but not, I think, before the end of the
war.”</p>

Lecture</span> on <b>Shell-shock and After</b>, read before the
Massachusetts Medical Society, Boston, June 18, 1918.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h3 id="terminology"><span class="smcap">Terminology</span></h3>

<p id="paragraph1"><b>1.</b> <b>Shell-shock, a lay term, usually refers to the medical
entity or disease-group: functional neurosis, or more briefly,
neurosis.</b></p>

<p>The history of the term Shell-shock will repeat that of
Railway Spine in the last century; the term will fall into
disuse when the cases subsumed thereunder get their exact
medical diagnoses&mdash;which, <i>statistically speaking</i>, will prove
to be as a rule psychoneuroses, either hysteria (pithiatism),
neurasthenia (nervous exhaustion, “prostration”), or psychasthenia
(obsessive neurosis).</p>

<p id="paragraph2"><b>2.</b> <b>But the laity cannot be got to use the term Shell-shock
in this exact sense, because the laity cannot make exact
diagnoses.</b></p>

<p>In the post-bellum and reconstruction period the physician
will need to guard against regarding all cases <i>called</i> Shell-shock
as really neuroses, merely on the ground that Shell-shock
is <i>probably</i> neurosis. Laymen will in the reconstruction
period succumb to the lure of the 100 per cent and gossip about
cures and failures in the same loose manner that is but too
familiar in discussions of Lourdes, Christian Science, the
Emmanuel Movement. It will be worth while to preserve
a certain generality and comprehensiveness for the term
Shell-shock, which will stand to medicine as the term weeds
stands to botany.</p>

<p id="paragraph3"><b>3.</b> <b>In short, keep the connotation but try not for any
denotation of this lay term Shell-shock in the lay mind!</b></p>

<p>The dangerous history of the term <i>dementia praecox</i> may
be recalled. Neither <i>dementia</i> nor <i>praecox</i> is an exact term<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_832" id="Page_832">[832]</a></span>
except for the statistical majority of cases of schizophrenia.
Yet does not the layman hearing the term <i>dementia</i> feel
entitled to assume that a victim must be <i>demented</i> or become
so?</p>

<p id="paragraph4"><b>4.</b> <b>The term Shell-shock appears to be a perfect term for
the ordinary man, as it means much and little, connotes
enormously and denotes a minimum and casts the lay hearer
back upon the expert.</b></p>

<p>But confronted by the term <i>Shell-shock</i>, the ardent social
worker or the ordinary man fails to get any incorrect notion
about the nature, and especially about the prognosis, of the
condition. If there is any suggestion of prognosis, it is the
correct suggestion of curability possibly conveyed by the
suddenness implied in the term shock; but I defy the ordinary
man to get from the ordinary term Shell-shock very much
that denotes anything in particular. All he gets is an enormous
connotation. This connotation may run back for the
race into tree stumps, savages brandishing spears, palatial
decorations, the protrusion of animal spirits, the Leyden jar
(sometimes familiarly known as the “shock bottle”), and the
aspen shaking of the man in fear or its interior equivalent.
But whether the slang runs back so far or no, and whether the
shell is a shell of powder or a shell of fear, and whether the
shock is of solid particles or in a moral sense, the problem
is implicitly laid down in the slang (see historical discussion,
Shattuck Lecture).</p>

<p id="paragraph5"><b>5.</b> <b>The terminological difficulties are clarified somewhat by
the French distinction of états commotionnels and états
émotionnels in the Shell-shock group.</b></p>

<p>The French very neatly distinguish what they term <i>états
commotionnels</i> from <i>états émotionnels</i>. They think of the
<i>états commotionnels</i> or commotional states much as we think
of <i>commotio cerebri</i>, that is, of a physico-chemical happening
in the brain of an essentially curable (or reversible) nature;
that is, of something that falls short of being, as they say,
<i>lésionnel</i>, namely, as bringing about a structural lesion. That
is, they distinguish a brain with a visible focal lesion from
one which has sustained a physical jar or commotion, and they
distinguish the effects of both of these from the <i>états émotionnels</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_833" id="Page_833">[833]</a></span>
or emotional effects of an injury. The nomenclature here
brings out one of the most fundamental difficulties in the
whole field of so-called Shell-shock, namely, the distinction
between structural conditions, microscopic or macroscopic,
on the one hand, and functional conditions of a psychopathic
nature, on the other. The <i>commotion</i> would affect the neurones
themselves in some perhaps invisible but still genuine
physico-chemical way, whereas the <i>emotion</i> would affect
these neurones merely after the manner of the normal emotional
life, except that the neurones would perhaps deliver
an excessive stream of impulses.</p>

<p id="paragraph6"><b>6.</b> <b>Terminology, especially in the matter of explanations
to laymen</b> (Americans demand monosyllabic explanations as
a preliminary to taking suggestions!), <b>is not always assisted
to clearness by physicians</b> on account of the old ontological
fallacy that Charcot insisted on.</p>

<p>Would that the medical profession understood neuroses at
their true value! Only too frequent is the impression on the
part of the profession that <i>imaginary</i> symptoms are by the
same token <i>non-existent</i>! I have even heard a physician well-trained
in somatic lines say that Shell-shock did not exist because
Shell-shock was nothing but neurosis, and neuroses were
characterized by imaginary symptoms,&mdash;accordingly neuroses,
being imaginary, do not exist! All of which reminds us
that many of the profession were entirely skeptical when
Charcot made his original observations. Some men here in
America felt that, whereas hysteria might occur in Paris, it
did not occur to any extent in America. The Shell-shock
data of this war will abundantly prove to the profession the
existence of the neuroses, and I feel that physicians will have
to brush up their ontology to the extent of conceding that
<i>a symptom may be</i> in a sense <i>imaginary and yet not</i> in any sense
<i>non-existent</i>.</p>

<p id="paragraph7"><b>7.</b> <b>Babinski points out a case of hysterical paralysis of a
leg which led the patient to lean so heavily upon his arm as to
produce an organic crutch paralysis.</b> It would be to no
point to argue that the hysterical paralysis was here non-existent.
Of course we shall have to meet the false analogies
drawn from methods of cure. If a paralysis can be cured in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_834" id="Page_834">[834]</a></span>
few minutes by the electric brush, or by hypnosis, or on emergence
from chloroform, or by some other modern miracle.</p>

<p id="paragraph8"><b>8.</b> <b>Is it too much to ask the profession not ever to say that
this rapid and seemingly miraculous cure was brought about
because the disease was non-existent?</b></p>

<h3 id="delimitation"><span class="smcap">Diagnostic Delimitation Problem</span></h3>

<p id="paragraph9"><b>9.</b> <b>The delimitation problem</b>, taken up in <a href="#A_PSYCHOSES_INCIDENTAL_IN_THE_WAR">Section A</a>, <b>is not
identical with the differentiation problem</b>, taken up especially
in <a href="#C_THE_DIAGNOSIS_OF_SHELL-SHOCK">Section C</a> but <i>passim</i> in Sections <a href="#B_SHELL-SHOCK_NATURE_AND_CAUSES">B</a> and <a href="#D_TREATMENT_AND_RESULTS_OF">D</a>; by delimitation
we may refer to the process of localizing the diagnostic battle
through exclusion of the other great groups of mental diseases
that <i>à priori</i> <b>ought</b> not to come in question, but do come in
question sometimes, before we slice down to the question.</p>

<p id="paragraph10"><b>10.</b> <b>Is there or is there not evidence of destructive lesion
in the nervous system of this so-called Shell-shocker? Is
this man a victim of organic or of functional neurosis? This
latter is what may be termed the differentiation problem.</b></p>

<p>Confining ourselves now to the delimitation problem,
what are the major groups of <i>mental diseases</i> that might
come in question?</p>

<p>I shall enumerate these. We think of mental diseases as
I, syphilitic; II, hypophrenic (that is, feeble-minded in some
of its phases, including even slight degrees of subnormality
not entitled to be called feeble-minded in the ordinary sense);
III, epileptic; IV, alcoholic (or due perhaps to some drug or
poison); V, encephalopathic (in the sense of some focal brain
disease); VI, symptomatic (in the sense of some somatic
disease); VII, senile (or presenile). The seven groups so far
enumerated, I believe, the general profession is pretty well
equipped to consider, at least roughly to diagnosticate and
to handle with due respect to the interests of the patient and
of the community. I am bound to say that some of my colleagues
would not go so far as to the competence of physicians
in general in these fields, and one is aware that a plenty
of mistakes have occurred even in these groups through the
bad judgment of practitioners. Nevertheless, I hold to the
conception that our profession is reasonably well equipped to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_835" id="Page_835">[835]</a></span>
handle these greater groups, having in mind all the while the
appropriate temporary calling-in of the specialist. But
there are two more groups, in addition to these seven, in
which I am not so sure that the general profession knows as
much as it should. I refer to VIII, the schizophrenic group,
commonly known as the dementia praecox group; and IX,
the cyclothymic group, sometimes termed the manic-depressive
group. It is the victims of the diseases that constitute
these latter groups that ought unconditionally to be
excluded with few exceptions from the army; and it is the
study of these conditions which ought to be carried out as a
part of every man’s post-graduate training, not merely for his
work on draft boards, but for his work in civilian and reconstruction
practice. There is another group of, X, psychoneuroses,
with which the profession regards itself as familiar,
and with which it doubtless is familiar, in what might be
called <i>blooming examples</i> of hysteria, neurasthenia, and psychasthenia.
But the nub of the situation lies in the fact that
the diagnosis of instances which are not such blooming examples
is difficult, and hence it was that I qualified my statement
as to the competence of the practitioner in this tenth
group. It is, of course, the tenth group, of psychoneuroses,
into which the majority of the Shell-shock cases fall.</p>

<p id="paragraph11"><b>11.</b> <b>Now a study of the literature of the belligerents having
Shell-shock in mind as its special topic and aim proves to require
a study of war literature in all of these groups.</b> There
are cases of so-called Shell-shock which even well-prepared
medical men have placed in the neurosis group, when they
should have been placed in one or other of the groups mentioned.</p>

<p id="paragraph12"><b>12.</b> In short, <b>whereas the Shell-shock delimitation problem
deals</b> with groups, I, II, III, IV, VI, VIII, IX and (as
our compilation shows) <b>especially with groups I, III and VI</b>,
on the other hand <b>the shell-shock differentiation problem</b>
deals primarily with groups V and X.</p>

<p>To clear the decks for action <i>re</i> the differentiation problem,
let us dismiss the major troubles of the delimitation problem
as shown in groups I (syphilitic), III (epileptic), VI (somatic)
and thereafter very briefly refer to the residue of the delimitation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_836" id="Page_836">[836]</a></span>
problem. For convenience of reference, a few out-standing
remarks concerning the general relations of these
divisions to war and peace conditions are inserted here. We
dealt in the diagnostic order of exclusion with 190 cases,
distributed as in the table below (bear in mind that the method
of this book precludes attaching great statistical weight to
the comparative figures, since the various authors published
their cases for their special rather than their typical interest).</p>

<p id="paragraph13"><b>13.</b> <b>The neuropsychiatric side of syphilis in the war</b>
is presented in 34 cases (Cases <a href="#case1">1 to 34</a>). The syphilitic
basis of sundry military difficulties, quite unsuspected by the
laity and probably not too well understood by service men, is
suggested by <a href="#case1">Case 1</a>, a case of desertion by a French officer of
high rank. Nor is <a href="#case2">Case 2</a>, in which visions of submarines
proved syphilitic, without its warning. Such cases point only
too obvious a moral:</p>

<p id="paragraph14"><b>14.</b> <b>Neurosyphilitics have no place in the army or navy.</b></p>

<p>Eight cases (<a href="#case3">Cases 3-10</a>) follow in which the aggravation or
acceleration or liberation of neurosyphilis has come about
under the conditions of war. Some of these cases suggest
the gravity of the problems of compensation, allowance and
pension that may arise. We might ask,</p>

<p id="paragraph15"><b>15.</b> <b>Should not a government which enlists a syphilitic
pay full allowances to him when under war conditions he
becomes a neurosyphilitic?</b></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_837" id="Page_837">[837]</a></span></p>

<p>For the government was theoretically able to learn at the
start (within a small margin of error by means of the serum
test) whether the man was syphilitic. If a one-eyed man loses
his remaining eye in an industrial accident in civil life, his
damages are often fixed at damages for total blindness; for
the industrial firm should not have employed a one-eyed man
in an industry dangerous to eyes. The principle cannot differ
with a man hired in a spirochete-bearing state: The company
has hired a man who may under traumatic conditions
become an incompetent neurosyphilitic, and should pay
damages accordingly when the aggravation begins.</p>

<p id="paragraph16"><b>16.</b> <b>What are the responsibilities of government if the
neurosyphilis is due to a syphilis acquired during the war?</b></p>

<p>Often such infection may be due to a tragical form of
“negligence.” But, as pointed out in a work on Neurosyphilis,
1917, I believe that any form of licensing system,
official or virtual, which would permit the purchase of syphilis
in or near military zones, abolishes the argument of “negligence.”
A man acquiring syphilis under the connivance of
government ought to stand as well as a syphilitic hired by the
government, when it shall come to the question of compensation
for incapacity. Yet, it may be argued, the man
might have remained continent after all. The point is left
to the mercy of jurists.</p>

<p id="paragraph17"><b>17.</b> <b>The share of neurosyphilis in the “crimes” and
disciplinary problems of the army</b> is intimated in three cases
(Cases <a href="#case11">11 to 13</a>).</p>

<p id="paragraph18"><b>18.</b> The latter part of the series (Cases <a href="#case14">14 to 31</a>) embraces
<b>problems of a more medical nature, touching traumatic
paresis and “Shell-shock paresis.”</b> Unusual, these cases
may be readily conceded to be; but their infrequency is not
such as to put them out of the field of consideration in the
“Shell-shock” group.</p>

<p>Very intriguing to the diagnostician would be the cases of
<i>pseudo</i>tabes and <i>pseudo</i>paresis (Cases <a href="#case23">23</a> and <a href="#case26">26</a> of Pitres and
Marchand), were such cases at all frequent.</p>

<p><a href="#case28">Case 28</a>, in which shell-shock (the physical event) apparently
caused recurrence of a syphilitic (!) hemiplegia, is
particularly instructive and might better belong with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_838" id="Page_838">[838]</a></span>
series (under <a href="#case286">Section B: Nature and Causes, Cases 286-301</a>)
in which <i>ante-bellum</i> weak spots were picked out by shell-shock
and war conditions. But <a href="#case28">Case 28</a> is placed here for its
syphilitic interest.</p>

<p><a href="#case29">Case 29</a> stands out as a warning example not to crowd the
hypothesis and try to make syphilis sponsor for everything,
even when it plainly is at work.</p>

<p><a href="#case32">Cases 32-34</a> are cases in which syphilis played a part,
though possibly a minor part, in certain peculiar mental
reactions.</p>

<p>To sum up the part played by syphilopsychoses and syphiloneuroses
in the war, we find, that</p>

<p id="paragraph19"><b>19.</b> <b>Syphilis may have occasionally a serious military
effect</b>, as in the case of desertion by a French officer of high
rank.</p>

<p id="paragraph20"><b>20.</b> <b>Important problems of pension, retirement, and compensation
are brought out</b>, and as no previous war has had
the benefit of the Wassermann reaction and other exact tests
bearing upon the nature, progress, and curability of neurosyphilis,
we may hope for a far more scientific determination
of these questions by review boards during and after the war.</p>

<p id="paragraph21"><b>21.</b> We find a few instances in which neurosyphilis has
played a part in the discipline of troops. According to one
author (Thibierge, 1917), syphilis has become a genuine epidemic
among French soldiers and mobilized munition workers.
In Germany, also, it may be remembered that Hecht has
claimed that no less than an equivalent of sixty army divisions
has been temporarily withdrawn from fighting on the Teutonic
side for venereal diseases. In this connection, Neisser
had recommended the giving of salvarsan and mercury in the
trenches. According to Hecht, the appearance of syphilis
should be a signal for sending a man to the front. Hecht
also made the somewhat bizarre suggestion that special companies
of syphilitics should be formed, for convenience of
treatment, on the firing line.</p>

<p id="paragraph22"><b>22.</b> A more solid foundation is laid for the theory that
<b>general paresis</b> may be <b>evoked by trauma</b>&mdash;a conclusion
already fairly well established by civilian cases, notably those
of industrial accident.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_839" id="Page_839">[839]</a></span></p>

<p id="paragraph23"><b>23.</b> The question whether shell-shock (the physical event)
can produce general paresis is probably to be settled in the
affirmative, for it may always prove difficult to show that the
physical shell-shock did not actually produce mechanical
molar lesions of the brain, permitting the rapid advance of
spirochetes. It is perhaps easier to prove that shell explosion
may precipitate neurosyphilis in the form of tabes
dorsalis (take, for example, Cases <a href="#case21">21</a> and <a href="#case22">22</a>). The cases
of most importance in the question of traumatic neurosyphilis
and traumatic paresis are cases <a href="#case20">20</a>, <a href="#case21">21</a>, <a href="#case22">22</a>, <a href="#case24">24</a> and <a href="#case25">25</a>.</p>

<p id="paragraph24"><b>24.</b> The picking out of preëxistent weak spots by Shell-shock
is given clear illustration, as in the case of Shell-shock
recurrence of an old syphilitic hemiplegia (<a href="#case28">Case 28</a>). Only
on such a basis could the syphilitic ocular palsy of <a href="#case19">Case 19</a>
be satisfactorily explained.</p>

<p id="paragraph25"><b>25.</b> <b>The coexistence of functional phenomena with organic
syphilitic phenomena is demonstrated</b> by Cases <a href="#case29">29</a> and
<a href="#case30">30</a>; perhaps also in <a href="#case16">Case 16</a>.</p>

<p id="paragraph26"><b>26.</b> It must be said that presumably there will be, unless
our authorities are more successful than in the past, a considerable
increase in venereal disease as the result of army life
in wartime. There will be a certain number of cases of
neurosyphilis a number of years after discharge from the
army caused by infection acquired during service. (Germany
is said to have got its crop of neurosyphilis after the
War of 1870, in the early eighties of the last century.) The
names of all soldiers acquiring syphilis and not considered
cured at the time of discharge should, under ideal conditions,
be given to health organizations in their home states so that
they may be accorded proper care and treatment.</p>

<p id="paragraph27"><b>27.</b> <b>Shell-shock and epilepsy.</b> The authorities have been
somewhat surprised by the number of epileptics that have
gotten by the draft boards. The statistics are not yet ripe,
but certainly the enlistment of an epileptic is not a rarity.
There are some singular instances in the war literature showing
how hard it sometimes is to bring out epilepsy. There is
the English case, for example, of a man, an epileptic’s son,
who had himself been epileptic from 11-18, who entered the
Expeditionary Force at the outbreak of hostilities, went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_840" id="Page_840">[840]</a></span>
through the retreat from Mons and through two years of
active warfare without having a single epileptic convulsion.
In fact, in September, 1916, he was put in charge of eight men
on guard duty. Apparently the new responsibilities worried
him, and two months later he had become epileptic to the
extent of petit mal.</p>

<p>Another man who had never been epileptic (though his
sisters had been) was wounded four times, was never worried
by shell fire, got somewhat depressed after the death of his
father and five brothers in the service, but did not become
epileptic until finally he was blown up and buried three
times in one day, and it was a whole month later when he
became epileptic, although treatment by rest and bromides
apparently resolved the affair.</p>

<p>Other cases seem to show that war experiences can bring
out epilepsy, although in most instances it would appear that
there was an epileptic or otherwise neuropathic heredity in
these cases.</p>

<p id="paragraph28"><b>28.</b> There is one author, Ballard, who has actually propounded
a <b>theory of Shell-shock as epileptic</b>, pointing out
the occurrence of epilepsy long after the early symptoms of
Shell-shock have disappeared.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> There does not appear to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_841" id="Page_841">[841]</a></span>
have been any increase in epileptics as the result of the war,
either from the standpoint of Shell-shock or from the standpoint
of brain injury, so far as the records of the National
Hospital for the Paralyzed and Epileptic in London are able
to show.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_10" id="Footnote_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> In one instance, fugue and other minor symptoms were
later replaced by epilepsy; in another, an epileptic confusion
developed eight months after an explosion, and in a third, a
case of mine explosion, stammering resolved into mutism
and mutism finally into epilepsy. Of course there is a so-called
general resemblance among all forms of hyperkinesis
or irritative discharge of the nervous system. If we term
epileptic all the things that various authors have termed epileptoid,
we may be doing nothing more than to say that we
believe these cases all subject to epileptic hyperkinesis.
In that direction, of course, it has long been said that dipsomania
was really a form of epilepsy. Whether Shell-shock is
ordinarily subject to recurrence in such wise as to imitate
the recurrence of attacks of dipsomania, of manic-depressive
psychosis or of epilepsy, is, to say the least, doubtful at this
time.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p id="paragraph29"><b>29.</b> As in all other instances of mental or nervous disease,
when an <b>epileptic returns from the war</b>, whether or not he
was potentially or actually an epileptic before the war, his
relatives are bound to term him a case of <b>Shell-shock</b>. I
am familiar with a case in a hospital in a certain Atlantic port,
a case of pronounced and obvious epilepsy. In the wards he
is treated as the hero of every occasion. Not only the nurses
and attendants, but the other patients and often the physicians
can hardly resist thinking of him as somehow a case of
Shell-shock. It is a comment upon the status of mental
hygiene in general that this self-same epileptic, had there been
no war, would have been, as it were, a common or garden
epileptic, mute and inglorious on some sunny hillside.</p>

<p id="paragraph30"><b>30.</b> In passing I may note how many instances in the
medicolegal part of the war literature there are of <b>epileptics
who come up for courtmartial</b> or for medical examination
pending courtmartial. We may suspect that many a case
of epileptic fugue has been regarded as a case of desertion.
There is the case of an epileptic who left camp one morning
and got drunk. Investigation showed that he left camp
before anything epileptoid had happened. He developed in
his drunkenness a pretty clearly epileptic crisis with great
violence, for which he had a complete loss of memory. The
French Council condemned him to five years of labor, not
admitting in this instance that responsibility was diminished
by reason of the man’s being epileptic. In short, from the
military point of view, he should, so to say, have known
enough not to have gotten drunk, and so have avoided getting
his epileptic crisis. Of course the decision was here
very close, and a like decision would not always be rendered.
To add to the complication of this particular case, the very
first epileptoid crisis which caused it to be known that the
man fell into the epileptic group was due to Shell-shock, or
at least developed immediately after the bursting of a shell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_842" id="Page_842">[842]</a></span>
nearby. On the whole, however, the relation between epilepsy
and Shell-shock is not a close one.</p>

<p id="paragraph31"><b>31.</b> <b>The question of epilepsy in the war</b> is considered
in a series of 33 cases (<a href="#case53">Cases 53-85</a>). The considerations
range from banal cases developing quite incidentally, up
to cases regarded by one author (Ballard) as illustrating
a theory of Shell-shock as epileptic (<a href="#case82">Cases 82-84</a>). First
are considered two cases actually syphilitic. In the first
(<a href="#case53">Case 53</a>), the diagnosis had to be revised from epilepsy
to neurosyphilis (the convulsions of this neurosyphilitic were
brought out by alcohol, and the reporter, Hewat, remarks
that the serum of any patient developing epileptiform seizures
between 35 and 50 years of age should be subject to test).
In <a href="#case54">Case 54</a>, the soldier got his syphilis in wartime and the
syphilis acted to bring out an epilepsy with which the patient
was hereditarily tainted (epilepsy syphilogenic, <i>i.e.</i>, reactive
to syphilis).</p>

<p><a href="#case55">Case 55</a> might perhaps better have been considered in
the group of hypophrenoses, as he was epileptic and imbecile.
He was at first condemned by court martial to five years’
imprisonment for leaving his post in the presence of the
enemy.</p>

<p>Another mixed case is <a href="#case57">Case 57</a>, in which another feeble-minded
subject showed seizures of a psychogenic nature,
which he was able eventually to stop by clenching his teeth.</p>

<p>Seven cases (<a href="#case58">Cases 58-64</a>) are cases of a disciplinary nature,
amongst which attention may be called to <a href="#case62">Case 62</a>, the
“specialist in escapes.” The medicolegal questions of responsibility
in the drunken epileptic (<a href="#case58">Case 58</a>) are particularly
perplexing.</p>

<p id="paragraph32"><b>32.</b> <a href="#case64">Case 64</a> is one of <b>epilepsy following antityphoid inoculation
one-half hour</b>. There were five attacks during a
fortnight and then no others. The antityphoid inoculation
came eight weeks after a shell wound of the thigh, which
had not served to bring out the epilepsy in this patient.
Bonhoeffer had three other instances of the sort: one in a
severely tainted subject, and the others in alcoholics.</p>

<p id="paragraph33"><b>33.</b> The next group of cases, <a href="#case66">66-77</a>, yields a series of the
most interesting <b>medical problems</b>, some of which scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_843" id="Page_843">[843]</a></span>
belong in an account of psychoses incidental in the war.
<a href="#case66">Case 66</a> is one with recovery from Jacksonian seizures after
decompression of the upper Rolandic region, which was edematous
following an (apparently very slight) scalp wound and
shell-shock.</p>

<p id="paragraph34"><b>34.</b> The cure by studied neglect (in <a href="#case67">Case 67</a>) is one of
<b>hystero-epileptic</b> convulsions occurring in series. <a href="#case68">Case 68</a>
demonstrates the superposition of hysterica phenomena over
a genuine epilepsy, a case therefore with two diagnoses: not
hystero-epilepsy, but epilepsy <b>and</b> hysteria.</p>

<p id="paragraph35"><b>35.</b> The theoretical implications of <a href="#case69">Case 69</a> are striking:
The case was one of musculo-cutaneous neuritis (gross enlargement),
in association with which <b>Brown-Séquard’s
epilepsy</b> developed, waxing and waning with the disease of the
nerve. Another case of possible reactive epilepsy is <a href="#case70">Case 70</a>,
and a case of epilepsia tarda brings up the same issue (<a href="#case71">Case
71</a>). <a href="#case72">Cases 72-74</a> are cases with strong psychogenic components,
of which <a href="#case74">Case 74</a> is particularly instructive on account
of the gradual building up of a remarkable visual aura of an
approaching fire-wheel, this aura developing after scotoma
from looking at the sun. Cases <a href="#case75">75</a> and <a href="#case76">76</a> are cases of somewhat
doubtful epilepsy, one of fugue and the other of a solitary
epileptic episode following 38 artillery battles in two
months.</p>

<p id="paragraph36"><b>36.</b> Friedmann discusses <b>narcoleptic seizures</b>, regarded as
due to the <b>brain fag of trench life</b> (<a href="#case77">Case 77</a>). Sham fits and
epileptoid attacks controllable by will appear in Cases <a href="#case78">78</a> and
<a href="#case79">79</a> respectively. <a href="#case80">Case 80</a> is a striking case of a man with
epileptic taint, which two years’ service, four wounds, the
death of a father and five brothers, and eventually Shell-shock
and burial thrice in one day, served at last to bring out.</p>

<p id="paragraph37"><b>37.</b> <b>Shell-shock and bodily disease.</b> In civilian psychopathic
hospital practice, if a case is not syphilitic, not feeble-minded,
not epileptic, not alcoholic, and without signs of
intracranial pressure or disorder of reflexes, then we, as specialists,
must consider whether the disease in question is not due
to some form of bodily disorder outside the nervous system;
for example, we think in practice of infectious psychoses, of
exhaustive states such as the puerperium, of toxic states<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_844" id="Page_844">[844]</a></span>
such as may be found in cardiorenal cases, and of glandular
phenomena such as we are familiar with in the thyroid disorders.</p>

<p>Under the war conditions, it might be thought that these
somatic disorders yielding the so-called symptomatic mental
diseases would be frequently found.</p>

<p>Aside from these rarities in puzzling diagnosis, we find more
commonly in the literature evidence of</p>

<p id="paragraph38"><b>38.</b> <b>The soldier’s heart, the so-called “D.A.H.,”</b> or disordered
action of the heart, of the English army reports.
This soldier’s heart is sometimes associated with hyperthyroidism,
and sometimes hyperthyroidism is found alone,
with symptoms suggesting those of a sort of diffuse Shell-shock.</p>

<p>One author claims rapid cures of hyperthyroidism by the
relatively simple process of hypnosis. Perhaps this is not
too unlikely in view of the still obscure relations between
mind and hormones. A little more surprising, perhaps, is the
assertion met with that psoriasis is sometimes a Shell-shock
phenomenon.</p>

<p>The literature clearly shows, however, that, as in most
special problems, the internist is still in demand. I recall
how one internist was misled on the witness stand into stating
that he was a “general specialist.” This is what we would
all need to be, were we to solve the problems of Shell-shock
in the time allotted to us by the war.</p>

<p id="paragraph39"><b>39.</b> Following are <b>special cases</b> to show how near the
somatic (“symptomatic”) may be to Shell-shock.</p>

<p>The somatic group of psychoses, sometimes termed symptomatic,
is illustrated in 29 cases (<a href="#case118">Cases 118-146</a>), and comprises
cases ranging all the way from rabic phenomena to
those of hyperthyroidism. Possibly the first two cases
(Cases <a href="#case118">118</a> and <a href="#case119">119</a>) might better be placed among the encephalopsychoses.
<a href="#case118">Case 118</a>, one of <i>rabies</i>, was that of a
farmer without history of having been bitten by a dog, who
eventually came to autopsy and received the Pasteur Institute
diagnosis of rabies. A diagnosis of angina was at
first made. When the symptoms became more serious and
masseter spasm developed, a question of tetanus arose. Later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_845" id="Page_845">[845]</a></span>
the diagnosis of meningitis was suggested. At this point, the
symptoms became predominantly psychotic.</p>

<p><a href="#case119">Case 119</a> was one of seven cases reported by Lumière and
Astier, in which delirium and hallucinations appeared as a
complication of <i>tetanus</i>. The case in question had been
given anti-tetanic serum. (Another case showed identical
symptoms without having been given anti-tetanic serum.)</p>

<p>That a local tetanus could be mistaken for hysteria might
seem <i>à priori</i> unlikely, but Cases <a href="#case120">120</a> and <a href="#case121">121</a> indicate as
much; and <a href="#case121">Case 121</a> is interesting on account of the officer’s
own description of his local tetanus and its treatment. A
psychosis apparently related with dysentery occurred in <a href="#case122">Case
122</a>. Hysteria followed typhoid fever in <a href="#case123">Case 123</a>. Another
form of typhoid fever complication is perhaps shown
in <a href="#case124">Case 124</a>, wherein the diagnostic question lay between
dementia praecox and a post-typhoid encephalitis.</p>

<p><i>Paratyphoid fever</i> has diagnostic complications, as shown
in Cases <a href="#case125">125</a> and <a href="#case126">126</a>, wherein the mental symptoms outlasted
the fever (<a href="#case125">Case 125</a>), and psychopathic taint was
brought out (<a href="#case126">Case 126</a>).</p>

<p><i>Diphtheria</i> was also represented in the matter of nervous
and mental symptoms in Cases <a href="#case127">127</a> and <a href="#case128">128</a>. In <a href="#case127">Case 127</a>
the nervous symptoms appeared eight days after evacuation
for diphtheria. There were a few sensory symptoms (hypalgesia,
hypoacusia, and peculiar bone sensations) in this
subject. The phenomenon in <a href="#case128">Case 128</a> was apparently one
of hysterical paraparesis; nor does it appear in this case that
the hysterical paralysis was preceded by polyneuritis.</p>

<p><i>Malarial effects</i> are present in three cases (<a href="#case129">Cases 129-131</a>),
of which <a href="#case129">Case 129</a> showed an amnesia, <a href="#case130">Case 130</a> a Korsakow
syndrome, and <a href="#case131">Case 131</a> anterior horn symptoms. <a href="#case132">Case
132</a> exemplifies 15 instances of acroparesthetic disorders in
so-called trench foot. This case, like several others, is inserted
in this group, not because the symptoms are psychotic,
but because they might cause diagnostic difficulty as
against hysterical phenomena.</p>

<p><a href="#case133">Case 133</a> is an autopsied case of bronchopneumonia following
bullet injury of the spine. Microscopic examination of
the spinal cord showed small cavities in the first and fourth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_846" id="Page_846">[846]</a></span>
dorsal segments. This myelomalacia was doubtless related
with the bullet injury of the spine, although the spinal cord
was not itself directly touched by the bullet. <a href="#case134">Case 134</a> might
be regarded perhaps as one of Shell-shock and should be
considered in relation with <a href="#case197">the cases at the head of Section B
(Cases 197-209)</a>. The case might be regarded as functional,
except for a decubitus that developed. Despite this decubitus,
there was recovery. The case is placed in the somatic group
on account of <i>pulmonary phenomena</i> which it seemed well to
relate with those of <a href="#case133">Case 133</a>. Compare also <a href="#case136">Case 136</a>, in
which reflex phenomena are associated with a bullet wound
of the pleura. <a href="#case135">Case 135</a> is a many-sided case, with ante-bellum
hysteria and certain Shell-shock phenomena. While
under observation, the patient caught typhoid fever and then
developed neuritis. This neuritis was very probably not
post-typhoidal so much as hysterical. Accordingly, the case
should be considered in connection with the ante-bellum weak
spot series, <a href="#case286">Section B (Cases 286-301)</a>. There was in this
case a cure by reëducation.</p>

<p>The reflex hemiplegia with double ulnar syndrome in
<a href="#case136">Case 136</a> seemed to have followed a bullet <i>wound of the pleura</i>.
According to the authors, Phocas and Gutmann, there is
considerable literature upon nerve complications of pleura
trauma, including syncope, epilepsy, and (more rarely) hemiplegia.</p>

<p><i>Heart cases</i> are illustrated by <a href="#case137">Cases 137-139</a>: the first one
of hysterical tachypnoea, and the others of the so-called
soldiers’ heart.</p>

<p><i>Diabetes mellitus</i> seems to have followed war strain and
shell wound in <a href="#case140">Case 140</a>.</p>

<p>It is doubtful whether shell-shock and burial had anything
to do with the appearance ten days later of <i>lipomata</i>, which
proved to be the initial phenomenon in a pronounced Dercum’s
disease. (<a href="#case141">Case 141</a>).</p>

<p><i>Hyperthyroidism</i> is illustrated in four cases (<a href="#case142">Cases 142-144</a>).
The first (<a href="#case142">Case 142</a>) appears to have been cured by inducing
deep somnambulism (Tombleson claims cures by suggestion in
eight cases of hyperthyroidism). Neurasthenia or questionable
Graves’ disease (<a href="#case145">Case 145</a>) followed Shell-shock. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_847" id="Page_847">[847]</a></span>
of <a href="#case144">Case 144</a> followed 10 months’ service, at times under
protracted shell fire. A <i>forme fruste</i> of Graves’ disease is
shown in <a href="#case145">Case 145</a>, in which the phenomena followed gassing
and shelling.</p>

<p>A somewhat curious <i>somatic complication</i> in a case of
Shell-shock hysteria was the finding of a needle in the left
upper arm, which was then extracted. (<a href="#case146">Case 146</a>).</p>

the delimiting material according to the order of the practical
key devised for civilian practice. We may now profitably
change our order of consideration and consider whether</p>

What do we really know about the neuroses other than to
say that they are <i>not</i> distinguished by the existence of the
structural lesions which characterize organic disease of the
nervous system? Is not the definition of neurosis purely by
negatives? However true this definition by negatives may
be from the genetic and general pathological viewpoint, the
work of Charcot and in particular of Babinski has yielded a
number of positive features from the clinical viewpoint,
which to some degree make up for the lack of anything positive
in the neurones themselves as studied post-mortem.
An eminent German has recently declared that the data
of this war itself go far to prove some of the long dubious
contentions of the Frenchman, Charcot; and the work of
Babinski during the war has strengthened and developed the
conceptions of his master, Charcot, as well as the ante-bellum
conceptions of Babinski himself.</p>

<p id="paragraph43"><b>43.</b> Let me insist that <b>the problem is practical enough:
Organic versus functional neurosis</b>. The point I want to
make is that, when so much theoretical doubt concerning
organic and functional neuropathy holds sway, the practical
doubts in the individual case under the varying conditions of
civilian practice and in the upheavals of military practice,
must be still more in evidence. Case after case described in
the literature of every belligerent has passed from pillar to
post and from post to pillar before diagnostic resolution and
therapeutic success. Colleagues meeting, for example, at
the Paris Neurological Society, find themselves reporting
the same case from different standpoints,&mdash;the one announcing
a semi-miraculous cure of a case which another had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_849" id="Page_849">[849]</a></span>
months before claimed only as a diagnostic curiosity. In
the midst of such discussions and controversies, there must
inevitably be a renaissance in neurology.</p>

<p id="paragraph44"><b>44.</b> <b>In cases of alleged Shell-shock, the hypothesis of
focal structural damage to the nervous system or its membranes
has to be raised.</b></p>

<p>Shell bursts and other detonations can produce <b>hemorrhage
in the nervous system and in various organs without
external injury</b>. Thus a man died from having both his
lungs burst from the effects of a shell exploding a meter away.
Hemorrhage into the urinary bladder has been identically
produced. Lumbar puncture yields blood in sundry cases of
shell explosion without external wound, and Babinski has a
case of hematomyelia produced while the victim was lying
down, so that the factor of direct violence through fall can
be excluded. In sundry cases, not only blood but also lymphocytes
have been found, sometimes in a hypertensive
puncture fluid.</p>

<p id="paragraph45"><b>45.</b> Moreover, <b>in cases of alleged Shell-shock there may
be a combination of structural and functional disease</b>.</p>

<p>A herpes or the graying-out of hair overnight can suggest
organic changes. A case may combine lost knee-jerks (suggesting
organic disease) with urinary retention (suggesting
functional disorder).</p>

<p id="paragraph46"><b>46.</b> Again, <b>there is a group of war neuroses</b>, especially
clearly brought out in cases of ear injury, <b>in which the functional
disorder surrounds the organic as a nucleus</b>. But
these “periorganic” neuroses are no proof that the neuroses
in question are organic in nature. Hysterical anesthesia,
paralysis, or contracture may occur on the side of the body
which has received a wound: <b>the process of such a peritraumatic
disorder is, nevertheless, a functional process</b>.</p>

<p id="paragraph47"><b>47.</b> But, when the problem is statistically taken, <b>the majority
of cases of alleged Shell-shock without external wound
prove to be functional, as indicated by their clinical pictures</b>.
Thus, after a mine explosion, a man was hemiplegic, tremulous
and mute. After sundry vicissitudes, the tremors were hypnotized
away. Then the mutism vanished, to be supplanted
by stuttering. Finally the hemiplegia remained. So far as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_850" id="Page_850">[850]</a></span>
the mutism and the tremors went, this man might belong in
the <b>majority group of Shell-shock cases, namely, the functional
group</b>. Assuming the hemiplegia to be really organic,
we should regard this man as a mixed case, organic and functional.</p>

<p id="paragraph48"><b>48.</b> <b>But do we not know all</b> we need to know or all we are
likely to know <b>about the neuroses already</b> from old civilian
studies? There are some cases without very close relations to
the war: Thus, we conceive of (<i>a</i>) psychoneuroses incidental
to the war and such that they might very probably have
developed without the entrance of war factors; and on the
other hand, we conceive of (<i>b</i>) psychoneuroses (to be dealt
with <i>in extenso</i> later) in which war factors (either physical
Shell-shock or other factors) forcibly enter. There are in
this group of incidental psychoneuroses 12 cases. The first,
described as a constitutional <i>intimiste</i>, a psychasthenic <i>en
herbe</i>, was one in which a hallucination was developed in
the field, and in which three phases of a psychopathic nature&mdash;(<i>a</i>)
over-emotionality, (<i>b</i>) obsessions, (<i>c</i>) loss of feeling of
reality&mdash;developed. In this case the war work at first
seemed to better the man’s general condition, and he gave
two years of effective service. This officer in effect <b>invented
his own Shell-shock equivalent</b> in a hallucination of Germans
appearing in his trench. The case may be compared with
<a href="#case347">one described in Section B, namely, Case 347</a>: that of a
Russian soldier who developed perfectly characteristic war
dreams, though his entire service had been rendered in the
rear and he had not had experiences in action.</p>

<p>Possibly <a href="#case171">Case 171</a>, that of <i>hysterical fugue</i>, might be regarded
as one of Shell-shock, since two shells burst near him
prior to his fugue. The man had had analogous crises,
certified by Régis, in adolescence, and had received the
diagnosis hysteria. In this instance, we are dealing merely
with an habitual somnambulist who has a characteristic
fugue following explosion of two shells. The war is in a
sense responsible for the fugue, yet not directly, and the fugue
would, without the stress and strain of war, probably never
have developed (see sundry cases in the group in which ante-bellum
phenomena are newly evoked in war: <a href="#case286">Cases 286-301</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_851" id="Page_851">[851]</a></span></p>

<p>The hysterical psychosis of an Adventist (<a href="#case172">Case 172</a>) might
be regarded as liberated by military service; the terrible fear
of the guns shown by the psychoneurotic (<a href="#case173">Case 173</a>) proceeded
to the point of fugue. A Shell-shock victim whose
war bride was pregnant, developed fugue with amnesia and
mutism (<a href="#case174">Case 174</a>). Under hypnosis, it appeared that his
fugue began with his running away from shells. <a href="#case175">Case 175</a>
was that of a neurasthenic who volunteered and had to be
sent back from the front after three months. In this case,
war dreams were supplanted by sex dreams, and the fear
of insanity became ingrained. The phenomena here were
largely ante-bellum and the war brought them out once more,
as might other disturbing experiences.</p>

<p><a href="#case176">Case 176</a> is here introduced to show that <b>neurasthenia may
develop in a man without hereditary taint</b> or acquired soil.
There was a very slight shrapnel injury of the skull, which
somewhat clouds the diagnosis in the case. Five months’
war experience brought out the neurasthenia. <a href="#case177">Case 177</a>
deals with a point in the diagnosis of psychasthenia, which,
according to Crouzon, shows arterial hypotension, a condition
important to distinguish from that of pulmonary tuberculosis
and of Addison’s disease. Compare this case with <a href="#case169">Case
169</a>: a case of depression treated by pituitrin. <a href="#case178">Case 178</a>
is a case of psychasthenia following several months’ service
by a man who probably should never have entered military
service.</p>

<p>Another case of ante-bellum origin is <a href="#case179">Case 179</a>. <i>Antityphoid
inoculation</i> appears to have been the initial factor in
the case of <i>neurasthenia</i> <a href="#case180">No. 180</a>. Compare <a href="#case65">Case 65</a>, epilepsy
after antityphoid inoculation. <a href="#case181">Case 181</a> was that of a
non-commissioned reserve German officer whose neurasthenia
was distinguished by <i>sympathy with the enemy</i>. He
did not want to let his men shoot at the enemy because the
idea came forcibly to him that the enemy soldiers had wives
and children. This symptom of sympathy with the enemy
was also shown by another German (<a href="#case229">Case 229</a>). Compare
the sentiments of a Russian under narcosis (<a href="#case555">Case 555</a>).</p>

<p>To sum up concerning the small group of psychoneuroses
presented in the section on Psychoses Incidental in the War,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_852" id="Page_852">[852]</a></span>
we are dealing with cases in which the phenomena are either
continuous with ante-bellum phenomena, or are of such a
nature that they might well have been brought out by other
factors than those of war. These cases by the design of their
choice throw little or no light upon the relation of physical
shell-shock or its equivalent to the psychoneuroses, though
in a few instances the factor of shell explosion is not entirely
to be excluded, and in one instance (<a href="#case170">Case 170</a>) a hallucination
may be regarded as a virtual equivalent of an emotional shock
of great compelling power.</p>

<p>Examples are available of hysteria (Cases <a href="#case171">171</a>, <a href="#case172">172</a>, <a href="#case173">173</a>,
<a href="#case174">174</a>), of neurasthenia (Cases <a href="#case175">175</a>, <a href="#case176">176</a>, <a href="#case179">179</a>, <a href="#case180">180</a>, and <a href="#case181">181</a>),
and of psychasthenia (Cases <a href="#case177">177</a>, <a href="#case178">178</a>, and possibly <a href="#case170">170</a>).</p>

<p id="paragraph49"><b>49.</b> <b>Let us now contrast with these specified ante-bellum
or non-war cases</b> the situation which will face us in <b>the war
group</b>.</p>

<p><a href="#B_SHELL-SHOCK_NATURE_AND_CAUSES">Section B</a> contains 174 cases (<a href="#case197">Cases 197-370</a>). Autopsied
cases (<a href="#case197">Cases 197-201</a>) are put first and are followed by cases
in which lumbar puncture data are available (<a href="#case202">Cases 202-207</a>).
A third group of cases is that in which so-called organic symptoms
are much in evidence, either independently or in association
with functional symptoms (<a href="#case208">Cases 208-219</a>). There
follows a small group of three cases with shrapnel wound
(<a href="#case220">Cases 220-222</a>), in which hysterical symptoms were prominent,
as against the prevalent and correct conception that
wounded cases are not so prone to psychoneurosis as non-wounded
cases. Three cases specially marked by tremors
(<a href="#case223">Cases 223-225</a>) follow, the last of which gives the victim’s
(a French artist) own account of his feelings. The next two
cases (Cases <a href="#case226">226</a> and <a href="#case227">227</a>) give respectively a German and a
British soldier’s account of Shell-shock symptoms.</p>

<p>There then follows a great group of <b>cases</b> (<a href="#case228">Cases 228-273</a>)
<b>arranged according to the part of the body</b> chiefly affected
by hysterical symptoms. The arrangement is one of toe to
top, or as one might more technically say, cephalad. This
<b>cephalad arrangement</b> naturally begins with cases with symptoms
affecting one leg or foot (<a href="#case228">Cases 228-235</a>). Then follow
cases of paraplegia (<a href="#case236">Cases 236-241</a>). As we proceed
cephalad then follow four cases of the so-called hysterical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_853" id="Page_853">[853]</a></span>
bent back, or camptocormia (Souques). Then come walking
disorders (<a href="#case246">Cases 246-248</a>). Still proceeding cephalad,
disorders of one arm and hand are considered in a series of
six cases (<a href="#case249">Cases 249-254</a>). Bilateral phenomena, symmetrical
or asymmetrical, follow in <a href="#case255">Cases 255-258</a>. Now reaching
the head, we deal with cases of deafness (<a href="#case259">Cases 259-260</a>), of
deafmutism (<a href="#case261">Cases 261-263</a>), of speech disorder (Cases <a href="#case264">264</a>
and <a href="#case265">265</a>), with two special cases (Cases <a href="#case266">266</a> and <a href="#case267">267</a>). Eye
symptoms are dealt with in a series of cases (<a href="#case268">Cases 268-272</a>),
and <a href="#case273">Case 273</a> deals with cranial nerve disorder supposed to
be due to shell windage without explosion.</p>

<p>The idea of the above arrangement of 46 cases (<a href="#case228">Cases 228-273</a>)
is that the reader dealing with cases of hysterical disorder
due to physical shell-shock, or some equivalent thereof, may
inspect the data in a few analogous cases described more or
less fully in the literature. By reference to the index, the
reader will be able to find still further cases to illustrate the
symptom in question.</p>

<p>The next series of cases (<a href="#case274">Cases 274-281</a>) are to illustrate
the contentions of Babinski concerning the elective exaggeration
of reflexes under chloroform, and the <b>conception of
reflex or physiopathic disorders</b> based thereon&mdash;a topic to
which return is made in <a href="#C_THE_DIAGNOSIS_OF_SHELL-SHOCK">Section C on Diagnosis</a>, and elsewhere.
A small group of cases (<a href="#case282">Cases 282-285</a>) illustrate the delay
of Shell-shock and kindred symptoms in certain instances,
cases that suggest a refractory period of greater length than
usual, or the interposition of some unusual factor.</p>

<p>The next group of cases (<a href="#case286">Cases 286-301</a>) is of special note,
bringing out what is discussed below, namely, <b>the emphasis,
reminiscence, or repetition of antebellum phenomena</b>, and
the picking out of weak spots in the organism by Shell-shock.
Possibly <a href="#case302">Cases 302-303</a> belong in the same group of illustrations
of the driving in of ante-bellum effects. Cases <a href="#case304">304</a> and
<a href="#case305">305</a> are definitively cases in which hereditary instability is a
factor, whereas Cases <a href="#case306">306</a> and <a href="#case307">307</a> form a foil to these, in that
the phenomena develop in subjects confidently stated to be
without hereditary or acquired psychopathic tendency.</p>

<p>The next series of cases (<a href="#case308">Cases 308-320</a>) shows <b>peculiar
phenomena</b>; <i>e.g.</i>, monocular diplopia, shell-shock psoriasis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_854" id="Page_854">[854]</a></span>
synesthesia, puerilism, and the like. Shell-shock equivalents
of various sorts are placed in a group of cases (<a href="#case321">Cases
321-325</a>). The next series of cases (<a href="#case326">Cases 326 to the end of
this Section: 370</a>) show tendencies to general neurasthenic,
psychasthenic, and other psychopathic phenomena, rather
than the more definite phenomena discussed in the early part
of this section in the series arranged “cephalad.”</p>

<p id="paragraph50"><b>50.</b> Rehearsing more briefly these findings, what is the
nature of these disorders? The literature is practically unanimous
on the point: <b>We have to do merely with the classical
problem of the neuroses</b>, and when all the data are some day
united, we shall doubtless know a great deal more about the
neuroses.</p>

<p id="paragraph51"><b>51.</b> <b>Locus minoris resistentiae.</b> That the process, whatever
else it does, is rather apt to pick out pre-existent weak
spots in the patient (the habitual gastropath becoming subject
to vomiting; the old stammerer stammering once more
or even becoming mute; the man always “hit in the legs”
by exertion, now becoming paraplegic) is obvious. The
striking instances in which an old cured syphilitic monoplegia,
or an old hysterical hemichorea, comes back under the influence
of shell explosion in precisely the limits and with
precisely the appearance of the former disease, indicate how
various a factor may be the <b>locus minoris resistentiae</b>.</p>

<p id="paragraph52"><b>52.</b> But, <b>without</b> weak spot, <b>without</b> acquired soil, <b>without</b>
heredity, we must now erect the hypothesis that, <b>the classical
neuroses may</b> in some, though certainly a minority of cases,
<b>afflict normal men</b>. Under the war conditions of investigation
touching the family and personal histories of the men,
perhaps we should not be too sure of this hypothesis; but the
army records will after the war allow us to make or break the
point forever and thereby throw the clearest light upon the
vexing problems of industrial medicine, wherein progress in
general has been so slow on account of the partisanship of
the corporation and plaintiff’s attorneys.</p>

<p id="paragraph53"><b>53.</b> <b>Purely psychogenic war cases exist</b>: Though Shell-shock
denotes, to say the least, <i>shocks</i> and <i>shells</i>&mdash;yet we
know Shell-shock <i>sans</i> any shock and <i>sans</i> any shell, nay
<i>sans</i> either shell or shock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_855" id="Page_855">[855]</a></span></p>

<p>The fact that a soldier may get war dreams though he has
never been in the fighting zone and never by any chance observed
the circumstance of war, or the fact that a man can
become mute on the second day after a shell explosion because
the night before he had dreamed of some hysterically
mute patients in his ward&mdash;these facts again, although they
argue a psychogenic origin for the phenomena of so-called
“Shell-shock,” do not at all mean that actual physical explosion
in other cases may not be tremendously important.</p>

<p id="paragraph54"><b>54.</b> This is shown by the exceedingly interesting phenomena
of <b>localization or determination of symptoms</b> to a given
region under the special local influence of the explosion. Thus,
in the schematic case, an explosion to the left of the soldier
produces anesthesia and paralysis on the left or exposed side.
Now and again a case will show such anesthetic and paralytic
phenomena upon the side exposed to the explosion and some
hypertonic, irritative phenomena upon the other side. One
gets the figure in one’s mind of an organism fixed, immobile
and numb, on the spot by the explosion&mdash;and the other half
of the body, as it were, attempting to run away from the
situation. One side of the body, as it were, plays ’possum,
the other tends to flight.</p>

<p id="paragraph55"><b>55.</b> Of course these physical phenomena should not blind
us to the emotional ones. Now and then the multiple causes
of a case may be analyzed, as, for example, one of blindness in
which a <b>series of factors</b> emerged, such as <b>excitement, blinding
flashes, fear, disgust and fatigue</b>. I cannot here go
further into these details, and I need no longer insist upon the
fact that <b>surrounding the problem of Shell-shock means
surrounding the problem of nervous and mental diseases</b>
as a whole, and that thus to be a Shell-shock analyst means
to be a neuropsychiatrist.</p>

<p id="paragraph56"><b>56.</b> The organic problems of the nervous system are
brought up constantly in differential diagnosis, but the
functional problems divide themselves up in a perturbing
manner into a fraction properly termed the “psychopathic”
(that is, after the manner of hysteria), and “non-psychopathic”
(that is, after the manner of reflex disorders of
Charcot, newly named “physiopathic” by Babinski).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_856" id="Page_856">[856]</a></span></p>

<p id="paragraph57"><b>57.</b> For the moment we are not discussing differential
diagnosis, but are merely trying to circumscribe the features
we wish to call <b>Shell-shock features: We have concluded to
call them functional&mdash;but what is it to be functional?</b></p>

<p>Too simple is the reply:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Functional</span> = <span class="smcap">Non-Organic</span>.</p>

<p>Inaccurate and misleading is the reply</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Functional</span> = <span class="smcap">Psychic</span>.</p>

<p>We may more correctly express the situation, pathologically
speaking, in the following categories (<a href="#chart18">see chart, page 870</a>):</p>

<p>ORGANOPATHIC (Lesional, destructive):</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) gross, or (<i>b</i>) microscopic, or perhaps (<i>c</i>) chemical.</p>

<p>DYNAMOPATHIC (functional, irritative, inhibitory,&mdash;but
reversible <i>ad originem</i>):</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) psychopathic; (<i>b</i>) physiopathic (“reflex”).</p>

<p id="paragraph58"><b>58.</b> As to the high psychic functions, we had thought of
them as split in hysteria, in dissociation of personality. And
we had roughly distinguished these conditions as <b>psychopathic</b>
from conditions we called <b>neuropathic</b>, regarding the
latter neuropathic disorders as on the model of the effects of
cutting off or destroying certain necessary neurons. However
clear or unclear we were as to the nature of the neuropathic,
it does not here matter. Babinski’s point is that
there is another kind of dynamic disease that operates, not
after the manner of hysteria, but after a manner reminding
one of the forgotten “reflex” disorders of Charcot&mdash;disorders
that fitted the textbooks so poorly that the textbooks
dropped them out. In short, what you might call <b>the
dynamopathic or functional in nervous disease has been
shown to fall into two parts</b>&mdash;a <b>psychopathic</b> fraction and
a non-psychopathic fraction. Babinski calls this non-psychopathic
fraction <b>physiopathic</b> or reflex. And these reflex
or physiopathic disorders have a different order of curability
from that of hysterical or psychopathic disorders. By what
simple device did Babinski prove this? By chloroforming
the patient. Under chloroform, when all the other reflexes
were stilled, Babinski could bring out, in relief as it were,
certain reflexes, or even hypertonuses, that were in the waking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_857" id="Page_857">[857]</a></span>
life wholly concealed,&mdash;yet at the same time consciousness,
in the usual sense of that term, had vanished. Accordingly,
the proof of a new type of functional disease, at times concealed
by the overlay of higher neurones, was now plain.
Does not this offer new leads of the greatest value in that
most intricate of fields, psychopathology? Is not the model
here offered of diseased <b>nervous functions</b>, <b>non-psychic</b> in
nature (in the ordinary sense of psychic) <b>but of almost equally
complex nature</b>:</p>

<p>Whoever wins the great war from the military point of
view, there can be no doubt as to what writers contributed
most from the war data concerning the doctrine of hysteria,
especially concerning the theoretical delimitation of hysteria
from other forms of functional nervous disease: There can
be no other answer than that, in theoretical neurology at least,
the French have already won the war, if only by means of
the remarkable concept set up by Babinski of the so-called
<i>physiopathic</i> (that is, non-neuropathic and non-psychopathic).</p>

<p>But how has this splitting of functional neuroses into
psychopathic and physiopathic been rendered certain? By
the tremendous modern sharpening of differential diagnosis
dating from, <i>e.g.</i>, the discovery of the Babinski reflex. This
brings us to the brink of considerations concerning the
differential diagnostic problem.</p>

<p>First it may be well to regard the whole problem in the
light of those mental diseases that we slid over when we were
delimiting Shell-shock as against syphilis, epilepsy and
somatic disease.</p>

<p id="paragraph59"><b>59.</b> <b>Why do some authors think of Shell-shock as an
“officer’s disease”?</b> It is clear that they cannot be thinking
so much of the physiopathic cases as of the psychopathic ones.
But psychopathic conditions are obviously more readily
brought about in complex and labile apparatus. This
point comes out strongly in relation with the <b>comparative
stability of the feeble-minded</b>, at least of most feeble-minded,
that get into war relations.</p>

<p>The possible relations of Shell-shock to feeble-mindedness
are of some interest. We know that Shell-shock picks out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_858" id="Page_858">[858]</a></span>
certain nervous and mental weaklings and indeed that one
author claims as high a percentage as 74 for war neuroses
having a hereditary or acquired neuropathic basis. How far
does feeble-mindedness itself count among these supposedly
susceptible nervous and mental weaklings? Is a feeble-minded
person especially in condition for Shell-shock?</p>

<p>There are rumors of experiments to show that if in an
aquarium containing some jelly fish alongside bony fishes,
you explode a substance, the jelly fish ride through unscathed
whereas the bony fishes are killed by the shock. The jelly
fish presumably had too simple an organization.</p>

<p>There is something to be said for the idea that in man also
the higher and more complex specimens are more susceptible
to Shell-shock, that is, to the neuroses of war, than are the
lower and more simple combatants. Some statistics indicate
that officers, who are in the main of a higher and more complex
organization than the private soldiers, are much more
susceptible than are private soldiers to the neuroses of war.
Doubtless we shall not be able to verify these statistics until
long after the war and, so far as I know, no very inclusive
statistics have been presented.</p>

<p>On the whole, I judge from the case history literature that
the feeble-minded, unless they be of that very high level
sometimes called subnormal, are not particularly susceptible
to the neuroses. It is obvious that idiots and, for the most
part, imbeciles, do not get into military service. As for
what the English term the feeble-minded or what we in
America are now terming morons, it may well be that our
draft boards do not always exclude. High French authorities
have specifically determined in certain instances that
the high-grade feeble-minded would be perfectly suitable for
certain branches of the service. There is the case, for example,
of a sandwich man of Paris who somehow got into
the French army and was being perpetually sent to look for
the squad’s umbrella and the key to the drill ground, but
sang and swung his gun with joy as he went to the front, and
apparently did very well there. This man had been a state
ward and, as you know, well-trained state wards are frequently
exceedingly good at elementary forms of drill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_859" id="Page_859">[859]</a></span></p>

<p>Then there is another case of an obvious imbecile who was
quite without any idea of military rank and often got punished
for treating his superiors like his comrades and was the
butt of his section, but on the firing-line remained cool, careless
of danger&mdash;a magnificent example to his comrades&mdash;at
last surrounded and taken prisoner. Here the story might
have ended and the folly of enlisting imbeciles in the army
might have seemed perfectly plain, except that our imbecile
forthwith escaped from the Germans, swam the Meuse and
got back to his regiment!</p>

<p>Here then are cases in which the slight degree of hypophrenia&mdash;it
seems unwise to give it the opprobrious title
“feeble-mindedness”&mdash;would have been entirely inconsistent
with the development of Shell-shock. Such men are,
perhaps, <b>too simple to develop neuroses</b>. On the other hand,
it would appear that certain of the slight degrees of hypophrenia,
such as we might find in so-called subnormal or
stupid persons, would prove capable of “catching Shell-shock”
as it were, and then find themselves entirely incapable of
rationalizing the situation. In short, <b>there may be a group of
psychic weaklings, just complex enough to fall into the zone
of potential neurotics, but just simple enough to render the
processes of rationalization</b> (or what one author terms <i>autognosis</i>)
<b>and of psychotherapy in general entirely unavailing</b>.</p>

<p>After the war we may be confronted with a number of
persons with their edges dulled by the war experiences. One
has met even brave officers who, after months of furlough,
still maintain that they will never get back to their normal
will and initiative. Whether these <b>hypoboulic persons</b> have
not been reduced to subnormality so as to resemble the
slighter degrees of hypophrenia or feeble-mindedness can
hardly be determined now. They will form <b>important problems
in mental reconstruction</b>, for with the best will in the
world, the occupation-therapeutist with all her technic, may
be unable to force or coax the will of such hypoboulics into
proper action. Nor will the ordinary environment of home
and neighborhood turn the trick properly. Expert social
work in adjustment, both of the returned soldier to his environment
and of the environment to the returned soldier,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_860" id="Page_860">[860]</a></span>
may be necessary. I speak of this problem here not because
these persons are hypophrenic or feeble-minded in the ordinary
sense, but we must constantly bear in mind our experience
in the teaching of hypophrenics (both in the schools for
the feeble-minded and in the community) when we are facing
problems of mental reconstruction.</p>

<p id="paragraph60"><b>60.</b> As for <b>alcoholism</b>, Lépine’s figures bespeak its importance
as a hospital-filler and a good deal of prime interest
surrounding alcoholism has been developed in the war; but
on the whole, so far as I can determine from the war case
literature, there is little or no direct relation between alcoholism
and Shell-shock, despite the fact that in a number of
instances alcohol has complicated the issue and very possibly
helped in a general demoralization of the victim. However,
the alcoholic amnesias and particularly a few instances of the
so-called pathological intoxication have exhibited a certain
medicolegal interest, recalling what was just said above about
the responsibility of a drunken epileptic. Alcohol remains,
I should say, pending exact monographic work upon this
topic, purely a contributory factor for the war neuroses.</p>

<p>It must be that the exigencies of the war have prevented
full reports of alcoholic cases; or perhaps they are regarded as
of such every-day occurrence as not to demand case reports.
The alcohol and drug group is represented by 17 cases (<a href="#case86">Cases
86-102</a>).</p>

<p>The so-called pathological intoxication is illustrated in
Cases <a href="#case86">86</a> and <a href="#case87">87</a>. <a href="#case86">Case 86</a> was entirely amnestic for an
attack of hallucinations in which he tried to transfix comrades
with a bayonet. <a href="#case87">Cases 87-97</a> are cases of disciplinary nature,&mdash;the
majority from a German writer, Kastan. <a href="#case88">Case 88</a>
illustrates desertion in alcoholic fugue, and <a href="#case90">Cases 90-92</a> are
three further cases of desertion in alcoholism.</p>

<p>Cases <a href="#case94">94</a> and <a href="#case95">95</a> give a <b>partial explanation of some German
atrocities</b>. At least, here are cases in which the atrocities,
with attempted murder and rape, are described more or less
fully in transcripts of medicolegal reports. <a href="#case98">Case 98</a> throws
a curious cross-light upon the war, in that a drunken soldier
got an unmerited long leave after paying 100 sous for an
injection of petrol in his hand. <a href="#case99">Cases 99-102</a> are cases of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_861" id="Page_861">[861]</a></span>
morphinism, illustrating the effects of the war upon the fate
of morphinists.</p>

<p id="paragraph61"><b>61.</b> <b>That war makes nobody go mad</b> in the asylum or lay
sense of the term <b>has been abundantly proved by the data
of this war&mdash;and this conclusion is of value in our medical
endeavors to establish a proper lay conception of the nature
of Shell-shock</b>. Consider first schizophrenia (dementia praecox).</p>

<p>That the causes of dementia præcox, still unknown as they
are, lodge more in the interior of the body or in special individual
reactions of the victim’s mind, seems to be shown by
the phenomena of this war, since there seems to be no great
number of dementia præcox cases therein produced. To be
sure, some schizophrenic subjects do get into the service, and
sometimes their delusions and hallucinations get their content
and coloring from the war. Thus a Russian, wounded in the
army, developed delusions concerning currents running from
his arm to the German lines and felt that he was, so to say,
the Jonah of the Russian front, as he could determine shell
fire to the spot where he was by the arm currents.</p>

<p>Now and then a case shows a scientifically beautiful admixture
of ordinary dementia præcox phenomena with the
effects of shell wound or shock. A picturesque case from the
standpoint of German psychiatric diagnosis is one of a soldier
who boxed the ear of a kindly sister who tried to steer him
from a room where the examination of another patient, a
woman, was going on. On the whole, the eminent German
psychiatrist who examined him felt that the case was really
one of psychopathic constitution, as he had shown somewhat
similar irascibility on a slight occasion before. However,
much to the astonishment of all, the patient developed further
symptoms. His ego got terribly swollen. At last he was
fain to utter a denunciation of the entire <i>Junkertum</i> and of
the Kaiser: he said in fact that he was an Inhabitant of the
World and not of Prussia merely. Over here we allow such
persons to edit newspapers and write books with impunity,
but the eminent German psychiatrist, before mentioned, was
constrained to alter his diagnosis of this cosmopolite from
psychopathic constitution to dementia praecox!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_862" id="Page_862">[862]</a></span></p>

<p>The group is represented by 16 cases (<a href="#case147">Cases 147-162</a>).</p>

<p id="paragraph62"><b>62.</b> There are four cases (<a href="#case148">Cases 148-151</a>) of a <b>disciplinary</b>
nature. The first (<a href="#case148">Case 148</a>) was actually arrested as a spy
because he was making drawings near a petroleum tank. Of
two cases of desertion, one was due to a fugue of catatonic
nature (<a href="#case149">Case 149</a>), and the other (<a href="#case150">Case 150</a>) was one of
desertion with behavior suggesting schizophrenia. However,
this man was determined to be responsible for his act, and
condemned to 20 years in prison. This latter case might be
considered also in connection with <a href="#III_EPILEPTOSES">Group III (the epilepsies)</a>,
<a href="#IV_PHARMACOPSYCHOSES">Group IV (the pharmacopsychoses)</a>, and possibly <a href="#XI_PSYCHOPATHOSES">Group XI
(the unresolved psychopathias)</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#case151">Case 151</a> was likewise alcoholic and disciplinary: the man
went so far as to keep a cigar in his mouth while the captain
was rebuking him and was, in fact, an old sanatorium case,
afflicted with some sort of degenerative disease, presumably
dementia praecox.</p>

<p id="paragraph63"><b>63.</b> That <b>schizophrenic symptoms may be aggravated by
service</b> is shown likewise in the case that follows, namely,
<a href="#case152">Case 152</a>, a man who had been hearing false voices for some
two years, had heard his own thoughts, and felt his personality
changing. The military board decided that the mental
disease had been aggravated by service. <a href="#case153">Case 153</a> might
offhand be regarded as a malingerer, as he shot himself in
the hand. Upon military review, a delusional state set in,
and in the course of no very long time a state of schizophrenic
apathy. In point of fact, however, this man had already been
in several hospitals for previous examination, and had served
in the army in relatively normal intervals. <a href="#case154">Case 154</a> is
that of a dementia praecox who volunteered for three years
in French infantry but forthwith gave indications of mental
deterioration. This case of a dementia praecox volunteer
may be compared with <a href="#case36">Case 36</a>: that of a superbrave imbecile
who swam the Meuse, back from a German prison;
with <a href="#case47">Case 47</a>, that of the feeble-minded person with an insubordinate
desire to remain at the front; with <a href="#case163">Case 163</a>,
a maniacal volunteer; and <a href="#case175">Case 175</a>, a neurasthenic volunteer.</p>

<p id="paragraph64"><b>64.</b> <b>Diagnostic questions</b> are brought up by <a href="#case155">Cases 155-166</a>,
in the former of which Bonhoeffer made at first a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_863" id="Page_863">[863]</a></span>
diagnosis of some form of psychogenic disease, possibly
hysterical, but had eventually to alter the diagnosis to hebephrenia
or catatonia. <a href="#case156">Case 156</a> was possibly one of Shell-shock,
though the man remained on duty for a month with
but one symptom, trembling of the arm. For nine months
he showed a variety of symptoms apparently consistent with
the diagnosis hysteria, but then developed catatonic and
paranoic symptoms clearly warranting the diagnosis dementia
praecox.</p>

<p id="paragraph65"><b>65.</b> Schizophrenia may not only be aggravated by service,
but as <a href="#case157">Case 157</a> shows, <b>war experience may have a definite
effect upon the content of hallucinations and delusions</b>.
Thus, a man wounded in the left shoulder built up the idea
of currents running from his left arm to the Germans, such
that if anything were touched by the arm, bombardment of
the Russians would at once start up. The arm, in short, was
charmed.</p>

<p id="paragraph66"><b>66.</b> <b>Psychopathic bravery</b> is not shown in the feeble-minded
only: <a href="#case158">Case 158</a> is that <b>of an Iron Cross winner</b> who,
after an hysterical-looking attack with hallucinatory reminiscences
of a Gurkha whom he had bayoneted, turned out to
be <b>hebephrenic</b>. <a href="#case159">Case 159</a> might at first sight have been
placed among the encephalopsychoses on account of the
trauma to the occiput, and in fact the mystical hallucinations
shown were of a visual nature (a rainbow-colored bird with
the face of the Holy Virgin). In point of fact, there was
probably no causal relation between the mystical delusions
and the brain injury.</p>

<p id="paragraph67"><b>67.</b> <a href="#case156">Case 156</a>, above mentioned, might perhaps be interpreted
as one of <b>Shell-shock dementia praecox</b>, but the interval
of nine months, though filled with hysterical symptoms,
is decidedly long in which to suppose that shell-shock factors
could be in process of causing dementia praecox. Cases
<a href="#case160">160</a> and <a href="#case161">161</a> are more suspicious. Six German soldiers were
killed by a German shell within the zone of German fire, two
steps away from the subaltern officer (<a href="#case160">Case 160</a>), who carried
on for some hours, made his report duly, but thereafter developed
tremors and lost consciousness. According to Weygandt,
the case is one suggestive of dementia praecox, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_864" id="Page_864">[864]</a></span>
very possibly should be regarded as one of psychoneurosis.
At all events, it would be dangerous to found a doctrine to
the effect that dementia praecox can be initiated by shell-shock
upon such a case as <a href="#case160">160</a>. <a href="#case161">Case 161</a> is similarly doubtful.
There are a number of symptoms in this man (the sole
survivor of an explosion in a blockhouse) consistent with the
diagnosis Shell-shock, and a number of others which hardly
can be given any other interpretation than that of catatonic
dementia praecox. But the available medical data do not
begin until five months after the shell explosion. We must
conclude here also that no definite evidence exists that
dementia praecox can be initiated by the physical factor
shell-shock. <a href="#case162">Case 162</a> is one in which there are shell-shock
factors and fatigue factors in a man who had once ante-bellum
shown signs of mental disorder, and who developed
delusions subsequent to a fugue following shell-shock. The
most one could make of this case would be to say that a latent
schizophrenia had been liberated by shell-shock.</p>

<p id="paragraph68"><b>68.</b> To sum up concerning the schizophrenias (dementia
praecox group), there are <b>cases of great disciplinary interest</b>
in which alleged espionage and desertion <b>turn out actually
to be schizophrenic phenomena</b>. Again, there are interesting
diagnostic problems in the differential diagnosis of hysteria
and catatonia. There is evidence that experience in the war
may be woven into the hallucinatory and delusional contents
of cases of pre-existent psychosis.</p>

<p id="paragraph69"><b>69.</b> As to the important question whether shell-shock can
initiate dementia praecox, the evidence from these reported
cases is against the hypothesis; but if the query be, whether
Shell-shock might not aggravate dementia praecox, it may
be stated that <b>a military board has decided that dementia
praecox may be aggravated by some forms of military service.
There is no reason to suppose that shell-shock factors might
not operate in this way.</b> Cases <a href="#case152">152</a> and <a href="#case162">162</a> will be of service
in the proof of this contention; and <a href="#case162">Case 162</a> seems to
be definitely one in which a latent schizophrenia, showing
itself in one ante-bellum attack, was liberated once more
after shell-shock. Of course, the plan of this book and the
method of choice of its cases precludes any statistical conclusions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_865" id="Page_865">[865]</a></span>
of great weight from the relative number of cases
found in the different groups; and it might well happen that
psychiatrists would not report cases of an everyday and commonplace
nature which might yet be very frequent. On the
whole, however, it would not appear that dementia praecox
is at all a frequent phenomenon in the war.</p>

<p id="paragraph70"><b>70.</b> <b>Nor can the cyclothymias</b> (manic-depressive psychoses)
<b>be charged up to war factors</b> to any important extent.</p>

<p>On account of the somewhat close resemblance between the
phenomenon of manic-depressive psychosis and what we
ordinarily feel ourselves&mdash;a logical situation reflecting merely
the fact that the phenomena of over-activity (mania) and
of under-activity (depression) are merely quantitative variations
from the normal&mdash;it might be supposed that the war
life and its shock and strain would start up the cyclothymias
in some numbers. Why should not a shell explosion start up
a mania or throw a man into a depression? In point of fact
the literature somehow does not agree with this presupposition.</p>

<p>Some years ago in Massachusetts a brief investigation was
made of the assigned causes of the successive attacks in a
great number of cyclothymic (manic-depressive) cases, and it
was found that each successive attack progressively had less
of the physical in the previous history. Something like 45%
of all the first attacks had a pretty obvious cause in the
soma, such as a kidney disease, a heart disease, a puerperal
condition and the like, but the second attacks failed to show
even 20% of such obvious somatic causes, and the third
attacks even less than 10%, and so on.</p>

<p>Now war conditions and even the shell explosions themselves
have apparently not set up any such conditions as
those of mania or of depression. Most of the instances of
cyclothymia are instances of men who are cyclothymic before
they enter the army. These experiences, when after the
war we can sift them all out, may allow us to form better ideas
as to the etiology of many of the psychoses, and the great war
may thus prove a gigantic experimental reagent which will aid
in solving some of the major problems of mental hygiene.</p>

<p id="paragraph71"><b>71.</b> <b>The cyclothymic or manic-depressive group is represented
in strikingly few cases</b>, seven in number (<a href="#case163">Cases 163-169</a>).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_866" id="Page_866">[866]</a></span>
One of the ideas in the literature concerning the
manic-depressive group has been that it is very possibly remotely
allied to Graves’ disease, a hypothesis upheld by
Stransky in Aschaffenburg’s Handbook. Hyperthyroidism
itself has been, of course, a rather striking feature in the foreground
or background of many sick patients in the war.
However, war factors have proved able to bring out very
few instances of cyclothymic (manic-depressive) disease.
Amongst our seven cases, the first (<a href="#case163">Case 163</a>) was that of a
maniacal Alsatian of 59 years, who volunteered because of
his hypomania. <a href="#case165">Case 165</a>, the case of a German who pelted
French trenches with apples from an appletree in No Man’s
Land, was another case in which the war had little or nothing
to do with the development of the mania. One of fugue
(<a href="#case164">Case 164</a>) was a case of melancholia and anxiety not closely
related with war experience. In three further cases trench
life and war stress may be thought to have liberated the
cyclothymic phenomena. <a href="#case166">Case 166</a> was that of a man of 38,
previously referred to, who developed arteriosclerosis and
whose depression and hallucinations had followed four months
of trench life devoid of battles or injury. It is possible that
this case should be regarded rather as syphilitic or of some
unknown organic origin. At all events, it is not clear that
it could be made to bear a heavy weight of hypothesis concerning
the genesis of cyclothymic psychoses. <a href="#case167">Case 167</a>, a
naval officer who distinguished himself greatly by work on
land in Belgium, was regarded by its reporter as one of
manic-depressive psychosis with the fatigue of war as its
base. It might be queried whether the man’s distinguished
work was not due to an early phase of hypomania, after which
the cyclothymic effects began. In <a href="#case168">Case 168</a> there was some
evidence of the effect of war stress, as certain hallucinations
grew more intense after the bombardment of Dunkirk; but
in point of fact, this man had shown a predisposition and indeed
a period of so-called neurasthenia ante-bellum. It is
doubtful, therefore, whether there is any case here abstracted
which can be used to support the hypothesis that the manic-depressive
(cyclothymic) group of mental diseases has had or
is likely to have its genesis in war stress. The remaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_867" id="Page_867">[867]</a></span>
case (<a href="#case169">Case 169</a>) is one illustrating a method of treating low
blood pressure in depression.</p>

<p>To sum up concerning the cyclothymias: War stress seems
to have had singularly little effect in the production of fresh
attacks, and so far as we are aware, no effect in starting up a
manic-depressive diathesis, unless <a href="#case167">Case 167</a>,&mdash;that of the
naval officer who distinguished himself in land battles,&mdash;looks
in that direction. It is, of course, to be conceded that
hypomania might readily be overlooked under war conditions,
and that suicidal melancholias, belonging in this group, might
be interpreted as natural war-made depressions. Very possibly,
therefore, this result (running to the effect that the
cyclothymic forms of mental disease are rare in military life)
may need revision.</p>

<p id="paragraph73"><b>73.</b> <b>Summary of general considerations: continued.</b></p>

<p>We found ourselves looking on the Shell-shock neuroses as,
like other functional neuroses, in a sense mental diseases.
Perhaps we would better say (to get rid of all suspicion of
medicolegal “insanity”) that the Shell-shock neuroses seemed
to us in some sense psychopathic. But, though the Shell-shock
neuroses looked psychopathic and were presumably
more functional than organic in nature, it was a curious thing
that, practically speaking, the Shell-shock neuroses proved to
be farther away from the more functional of the psychoses
than from certain organic psychosis.</p>

<p>In particular, we found reliable authors insisting on the
<i>practical</i> diagnostic necessity of excluding syphilis, epilepsy,
somatic disease&mdash;whereas the nature and causes of the Shell-shock
neurosis seemed <i>theoretically</i> to withdraw them most
remotely from that triad of mainly organic disorders. By the
same token, <i>theoretically</i> one might have supposed these
Shell-shock neuroses to draw very near to those far less
organic disorders (schizophrenia, cyclothymia, feeble-mindedness
(<i>i.e.</i>, the slighter degrees likely to be found in military
service, alcoholism))&mdash;yet <i>practically</i> few large diagnostic
problems came to light as between the Shell-shock neuroses
and the tetrad of dynamic or lightly organic diseases above
listed.</p>

<p>But why should the Shell-shock neuroses seem so “organic”?
Partly, it is probable, because the term<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_871" id="Page_871">[871]</a></span> “organic”
is too often used to mean “subcortical.” In another diagram
the truer relations are depicted, with four classes of

<p id="paragraph75"><b>75.</b> <b>Having disposed of the problem of the rougher</b> <span class="smcap">Delimitation</span>
<b>of the Shell-shock neuroses, we approach the
problem of their finer</b> <span class="smcap">Differentiation</span>. <b>For the sake of

whether in the ordinary mind-born (psychogenic) sense of
classical hysteria or in the modern nerve-born (neurogenic)
sense of Babinski. The problem of this differentiation will
accordingly be that between the dynamopathic and the
organopathic.</b></p>

<p>In the orderly diagnosis of mental disease, from the standpoint
of the major orders or groups, we ordinarily come at
this point to the focal brain diseases. In analyzing the neuro-psychiatric
problem of a so-called Shell-shocker, it is, of
course, our bounden duty to exclude syphilis. Even though
the percentage of syphilitic victims of Shell-shock is not high,
yet these cases promise so much from treatment that they
deserve to get their diagnosis as early as possible, and the
English workers who have worked most in the syphilitic
field insist upon this point.</p>

<p>We next proceed, as above indicated, to the elimination of
hypophrenia with all the various grades of feeble-mindedness.
Thirdly, we try to exclude the various forms of epilepsy;
and fourthly, the effects of alcohol, drugs and poisons.</p>

<p>In ordinary civilian practice, such as that at the Psychopathic
Hospital, the orderly elimination for diagnostic purposes
of the great groups of the syphilitic, hypophrenic
(feeble-minded), epileptic and alcoholic, leaves us with cases
in which there either is or is not important evidence of organic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_872" id="Page_872">[872]</a></span>
nervous-system disease, such as that shown in cases
with heightened intracranial pressure or in cases with asymmetry
of reflexes and other forms of parareflexia. In military
practice these logical questions of prior elimination of
syphilis, feeble-mindedness, epilepsy, and alcoholism must go
a-glimmering at first, unless their signs are so obvious as to
permit diagnosis by inspection.</p>

<p id="paragraph76"><b>76.</b> But the nervous and mental cases almost one and all
give rise to <b>the suspicion</b> at least of <b>organic disease</b>, possibly
traumatic in origin. Even when a man falls to the ground
without a scratch upon his skin, there is some question
whether in his fall he has not sustained some slight intracranial
hemorrhage which the lumbar puncture fluid might
show. Add to this that the signs of hysteria are very often
unilateral, and it will readily be conceived how much like an
organic case an hysteric in the casualty clearing station may
look. Rapid decision may be necessary in order to get immediate
effects in psychotherapy a few minutes or hours after
the shell explosion, and one may need to choose between
applying a possibly unsuccessful psychotherapy forthwith and
making a thorough neurological examination. As Babinski
has pointed out, making a thorough neurological examination
gives opportunity for all sorts of medical suggestion to be
conveyed to the patient. It would appear that many an
hysterical anesthesia has been given to a patient by the very
suggestion of the physician testing sensation. Here one does
not refer to malingering in the conscious and designed sense
of the term, but to the operation of some genuinely psychopathic,
that is to say, hysterical process.</p>

<p id="paragraph77"><b>77.</b> In the case of head injury, naturally the majority of
nerve phenomena will ordinarily be upon the opposite side
of the body to the side of the head that is injured. The
reverse situation holds for hysterical cases, wherein it would
appear that the bursting of a shell, let us say upon the left
side of the body, seems to determine contractures, paralyses
and anesthesias to that same left side of the body; now and
then complicated cases appear which put the neurologist
through his best paces. Such a case is that of a man who was
wounded on the left side of the head and promptly developed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_873" id="Page_873">[873]</a></span>
a <b>hemiplegia</b> on the same (<b>left</b>) side, <b>with aphasia</b>. Now
aphasia ought to be the result of a lesion on the left side of
the brain in the common run of cases, whereas left-sided hemiplegia
ought to be the result of lesion on the right side of the
brain. In point of fact, the analyst of this case felt that he
was dealing with a direct injury on the left side of the brain,
leading to aphasia, and a lesion by <b>contrecoup</b> on the right
side of the brain, leading to a left-sided hemiplegia.</p>

<p>It is not only at the casualty clearing stations and along
the lines of communication that the difficulties in telling
Shell-shock in the neurotic sense from traumatic psychosis
and the effects of focal brain lesions are found, since the literature
amply shows that diagnostic problems remain open for
weeks or months in the various institutions of the interior,
to which all the belligerents have been forced to send their
cases.</p>

<p id="paragraph78"><b>78.</b> A glance at the differential tables that have been developed,
for example, by the French neurologists, will show
how fine the diagnosis betwixt a hysterical and an organic
disease may be, especially when we consider how often there
are admixtures of the two. The rule holds for the vast majority
of cases that absolute bullet wounds or shrapnel
wounds do not produce Shell-shock; and the statistical story
is so clear that one might almost think of the wounds as in
some sense protective against shock, that is, against Shell-shock,
not against traumatic or surgical shock. Nevertheless,
by some process whose nature is obscure, the hysteric is
apt to pick up some slight wound and, as it were, surround
this wound with hysterical anesthesia, hyperesthesia, paralysis
or contractures.</p>

<p>The chances are, if we should collect all our civilian cases
of Railway Spine and of industrial accident with traumatic
neuroses, we should be able to prove this same strange relation
between slight wound in a particular part of the body
and the local determination of hysterical symptoms to that
region. Of course, the determination follows no known laws
of nerve distribution to skin or muscles, and the effect is
apparently a psychopathic or, at all events, a dynamic process
without clear relations to the accepted landmarks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_874" id="Page_874">[874]</a></span></p>

<p>I do not mean to suggest, that aside from the hurry of war,
the differential diagnoses here are more difficult than those
in civilian practice; but the difficulties are at least as great
as those that have faced the civilian practitioner. What
needs emphasis is that just because we have concluded that
the statistical majority of the cases of so-called Shell-shock
belongs in the division of the neuroses, we should <b>not feel</b>
too <b>cock-sure that</b> a given case of <b>alleged Shell-shock</b> appearing
in the war zone or behind it <b>is necessarily</b> a case of <b>neurosis</b>.</p>

<p>After the early “period of election” for psychotherapy
in the war zone has passed, there can be no excuse except
general war conditions for not according to every case of
alleged Shell-shock a complete neuropsychiatric examination,
having due regard to the ideas of Babinski concerning medical
suggestion of new increments and appendices to the original
hysteria, developed in battle or shortly thereafter.</p>

<p>We have, however, been able to find in the literature good
instances of puzzling diagnosis in which such conditions are
in evidence as acute meningitis of various forms, hydrophobia,
tetanus, and the like.</p>

<p>Especially in the diagnosis against Shell-shock hysterias
we may need to think of the abnormal forms of tetanus, to
which an entire book in the <i>Collection Horizon</i> has been devoted.
The differential diagnostic tables here draw up distinctions
between local tetanus, involving, let us say, the contracture
of one arm, as against a hysterical monoplegia.</p>

<p id="paragraph79"><b>79.</b> The focal brain group of psychoses here termed encephalopsychoses,
is illustrated by a comparatively short
series of cases, 16 in number (<a href="#case103">Cases 103-117</a>). Many more
cases of this group are presented in <a href="#B_SHELL-SHOCK_NATURE_AND_CAUSES">Section B, On the Nature
and Causes of Shell-shock</a>. The motive here is to show
sundry effects of focal brain lesions produced in the war and
not related with shell-shock. <a href="#case103">Case 103</a> was the curious case
(see above) of aphasia with hemiplegia&mdash;not upon the right
side, but upon the left side. There had been a wound in
the left parietal region, and the aphasia was presumably consequent
upon a direct affection of the left hemisphere. On
the other hand, the left-sided hemiplegia may probably be
regarded as due to lesions on the right side of the brain produced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_875" id="Page_875">[875]</a></span>
by contrecoup. The case not only has surgical implications
and suggestions of importance, but also it throws
some light on the possibilities in concussion of minor degree.
As the cases in <a href="#B_SHELL-SHOCK_NATURE_AND_CAUSES">Section B (On the Nature and Causes of Shell-shock)</a>
show, shell-shock, the physical factor, is apt to produce
anesthesia and paralysis or contracture on the side exposed
to the shell-shock. The means by which these symptoms
ipsilateral with the shock are produced is commonly
thought to be the “hysterical mechanism,” whatever that
may be. Lhermitte, however, suggests that in some cases
such phenomena might be due to an actual brain jarring with
contrecoup effects. However, it must be granted that <a href="#case103">Case
103</a> did not come to autopsy.</p>

<p id="paragraph80"><b>80.</b> <a href="#case104">Case 104</a> might perhaps better be considered in the
section on alcoholism, since a gun-shot wound of the head
may be regarded as having produced intolerance of alcohol
in the classical manner, similar to that described in <a href="#case97">Case
97</a>, wherein, however, the trauma was ante-bellum. Peculiar
crises associated with cortical blindness, vertigo, and
hallucinations, characterized a case of brain trauma by bullet
(<a href="#case105">Case 105</a>). <a href="#case106">Case 106</a> is that of a Tunisian, who before the
war had had a number of theopathic traits with mystical
hallucinations, but after a gun-shot wound of the occiput
developed lilliputian hallucinations and micromegalopsia.</p>

<p id="paragraph81"><b>81.</b> <a href="#case107">Cases 107-112</a> are cases of infection or probable infection.
Cases <a href="#case107">107</a> and <a href="#case108">108</a> are instances of meningococcus
meningitis, the second of which appears to have followed
shell-shock (?). <a href="#case107">Case 107</a> led to psychosis with dementia.
<a href="#case109">Case 109</a> developed a meningitic syndrome, which followed
shell explosion a metre away, the syndrome lasting 14 months.
The spinal puncture fluid was several times found to contain
blood. There was apparently no infection of the fluid as in
<a href="#case112">Case 112</a>. Possibly <a href="#case109">Case 109</a> should be set down as an unusual
example of shell-shock psychosis, chiefly dependent
upon meningeal hemorrhage.</p>

<p id="paragraph82"><b>82.</b> A syphilitic (<a href="#case110">Case 110</a>) in which appropriate tests were
made and found positive, showed at autopsy a yellowish
abscess or area of softening in the right hemisphere. The
curious point about this case was that the only neurological<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_876" id="Page_876">[876]</a></span>
phenomenon in the case was the absence of knee-jerks in the
early part of the day; later in the day, they would appear
once more. Possibly <a href="#case111">Case 111</a>, a case of somewhat doubtful
nature but presumably of organic hemiplegia, ought to be
aligned more with the group of cases illustrating the nature
and causes of Shell-shock. The case was not one with the
physical factor shell-shock, since the phenomena began ten
days after a serene convalescence following an operation for
chronic appendicitis. Perhaps the case was one of organic
lesion grafted upon a neurosis.</p>

<p id="paragraph83"><b>83.</b> <a href="#case112">Case 112</a> is the one noted above of infection of the
spinal fluid. It is the only case of infected meningeal hemorrhage
observed by Guillain and Barré in a wide experience.
As a rule, these hemorrhages remain aseptic and have a
favorable prognosis. The organism cultivated from the spinal
fluid proved to be the pneumococcus. <a href="#case113">Case 113</a> yielded a
somewhat remarkable phenomenon and perhaps would be
more logically considered in relation with the series of cases
in <a href="#B_SHELL-SHOCK_NATURE_AND_CAUSES">Section B</a> that show the picking up of ante-bellum weak
spots (<a href="#case287">Cases 287-301</a>); for this subject had had two serious
affections of the brain ante-bellum. He had had a poliomyelitis
at five, affecting the left leg, and he had had a right
hemiplegia with aphasia following pneumonia, at 20. He
was struck (but apparently not wounded) by shrapnel on the
right shoulder, and developed athetotic movements of the
right hand, as well as a general weakness of the left leg. In
this case, according to Batten, the stress had been sufficient
to bring into prominence symptoms due to an old cerebral
lesion. Whether the mechanism in this case is hysterical is
doubtful.</p>

<p id="paragraph84"><b>84.</b> That not every case of hemianesthesia is hysterical is
suggested by <a href="#case114">Case 114</a>, in which the diagnosis of hysteria
was actually made; but the diagnosis was soon rendered
doubtful by the fact that there was no evidence of autosuggestion
or heterosuggestion. Other phenomena make a
diagnosis of thalamic hemianesthesia more likely.</p>

<p id="paragraph85"><b>85.</b> Although Shell-shock is not the subject of this section,
yet a case of syndrome strongly suggesting multiple sclerosis
is here inserted, following shell-shock (<a href="#case115">Case 115</a>). The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_877" id="Page_877">[877]</a></span>
co-existence of hysterical and organic symptoms is illustrated
in <a href="#case116">Case 116</a>, one of mine explosion, and <a href="#case117">Case 117</a>, one
of injury to back. <a href="#case116">Case 116</a> somewhat resembled another

<p>The physical event, shell-shock, has likewise caused focal
irritative and destructive brain disease, spinal cord disease,
peripheral nerve disease; and many well-recognized species
of the so-called “organic” diseases of the nervous system
have been produced. Shell-shock “organic” diseases have
proved as difficult to tell from all sorts of Shell-shock “functional”
diseases as ever have been the organic and functional
analogues of these diseases in peace practice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_881" id="Page_881">[881]</a></span></p>

<p>But, besides (<i>a</i>) sharing in the cause of mental and nervous
disease (in the sense of “Shell-shock” general paresis and
“Shell-shock” tabes, wherein at least one other factor, <i>viz.</i>
the spirochete, is known to be at work) and (<i>b</i>) producing
mental and nervous disease by killing or weakening or sensitizing
neurones in the classical manner of the “focal” lesion,
the physical event, Shell-shock, (<i>c</i>) appears able to bring out
the subtler diseases and dispositions of mind which we term
psychoneuroses, that is, hysteria, neurasthenia, psychasthenia.
Just as we have for years spoken of “traumatic” psychoneuroses,
so we may now speak of “Shell-shock” psychoneuroses&mdash;nor
should anyone believe we cheat ourselves with the
idea that the adjective “Shell-shock” has helped us more <i>re</i>
genesis than the adjective “traumatic.” “Shell-shock hysteria”
and “traumatic hysteria” are on precisely the same&mdash;slippery&mdash;footing
in the matter of their origin. The
physics and chemistry of the psychoneuroses remain in Egyptian
darkness.</p>

<p>The physical event, shell-shock, then, as the common man
might say, affects body, brain, and mind in a great number of
familiar ways; and these familiar ways remain as plain or
as blind as the neuropathology and the psychopathology of
today leave them. If thunderstorms and earthquakes got
suddenly more frequent, we should have numbers of “lightning
neuroses” and “earthquake hysterias,” neither of
which would render the physics and chemistry of the psychoneuroses
immediately a whit clearer.</p>

<p>When the common man speaks of some one as suffering
from lightning stroke or earthquake, he is entitled to be met
halfway by his hearer, who readily understands that the
victim is suffering some sort of transient or permanent effects
of the stroke or quake. In a like common sense should the
term shell-shock be taken. Stroke, quake, or shock, each
physical event is recognized as a factor in the situation. An
event has become a factor. A condition for which the noun
“shell-shock” was descriptive, in the present tense of some
event, has passed into history; and the adjective “shell-shock”
is now explanatory of the past cause, or one of the
past causes, of a new situation. Shell-shock, the physical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_882" id="Page_882">[882]</a></span>
event, takes part in a great number of pathological events
and as such lapses from noun to adjective.</p>

<p>But what are these pathological events, <i>viz.</i>, the conditions
of disease, that supervene? So far, in our consideration of
psychoses incidental in the war, we have found Shell-shock
<i>varieties</i>, perhaps, of mental disease; again, possibly a few
Shell-shock <i>species</i>, using both these terms, variety and
species, in a quasi botanical or zoölogical sense. But in
either instance we do not rise, under the ordinary principles
of nomenclature, beyond the adjective: Is there any evidence
that shell-shock, the physical happening, has issued in a
pathological event of greater dignity, namely, a <i>genus of
disease</i>? Can shell-shock rise to the dignity of a proper
noun, Shell-shock, so that we might think of <i>e.g.</i>, a new genus
of the psychoneuroses, something coördinate with hysteria,
neurasthenia, psychasthenia? None, I believe, has the
hardihood to propose a new genus of mental or nervous
disease for Shell-shock regarded as a pathological event.
<i>A fortiori</i>, it is unheard-of to think of Shell-shock, the pathological
event, as representing a new <i>order</i> of such events,
coördinate with the psychoneuroses or the epilepsies, for
example.</p>

<p>Shell-shock, the pathological event, we conclude, is a variety
or a species, hardly a genus or an order of mental or nervous
diseases. If we can keep in mind the obvious distinction
between shell-shock, the physical event, and Shell-shock, the
pathological event, we shall save ourselves much trouble.
And if we can apply the ordinary criteria for the differentiation
of the great groups (or orders) and the lesser groups (or genera)
of mental and nervous disease to the given concrete case, we
shall not go far wrong therapeutically in any case of so-called
Shell-shock. For Shell-shock, the pathological event,
becomes a humble variety or species of disease whose therapeutic
indications are in larger part those of higher and comparatively
well-recognized genera of disease, <i>e.g.</i>, hysteria,
neurasthenia, psychasthenia.</p>

<p>A shock is not a smash, a crush, a breach. A shock literally
shakes. The shaken thing stays, for a time at least.
Shaken up or down, the victim of shock is not at first thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_883" id="Page_883">[883]</a></span>
of as done for. The spirit of the language is against the
thought of shock as destruction or even as permanent irritation.
Shock ought to be a “functional” rather than an
“organic” thing, as medicine bandies these terms about.
Shell-shock or Surgical Shock, it is all one to the logic of shock,
which is thought of as a physical or chemical disturbance of
mechanisms and arrangements that are, or ought to be readjustable.
The one character which the late Professor Royce
told me (in conversation) he could find in the term “functional”
was the idea “reversible.” Shock is or ought to be,
as a pathological event, reversible.</p>

<p>If this thought is in the backs of our minds as we think of
Shell-shock, it can readily be seen why the “organic,” that is,
non-reversible diseases, do not take kindly to the term Shell-shock.
Shell-shock, the pathological event, prefers to be an
item in the pathology of function. Can we further specify?
The pathology of function, neuropsychically taken, considers
such great groups as the psychoneuroses; (so far as we know)
the cyclothymias; some of the symptomatic psychoses;
a portion of the alcohol and drug group; some of the epilepsies;
perhaps the dementia præcox group; not to mention
various unresolved psychopathias. The psychoneuroses are
the group most innocent of every “organic” taint: the
machinery is assumed to be most normal in them and presumably
the effects of disorder most reversible.</p>

<p>Shall we not therefore accept the psychoneuroses as the
group in which to place those pathological happenings called
Shell-shock? It will do no harm to make this choice if we
do it humbly in the spirit of acknowledgment that we know
next to nothing about the psychoneuroses. The psychoneuroses
should fall on their knees to Shell-shock rather than
that Shell-shock make obeisance to the psychoneuroses. For
what is a psychoneurosis? It is a functional disease of the
nervous system in which the mind plays an important part&mdash;it
is also probably much else. But the “much else” is as
likely to be found in Shell-shock as anywhere else during these
particular years.</p>

<p>Thus, rehearsing in a broad way <b>the case arrangement of
<a href="#B_SHELL-SHOCK_NATURE_AND_CAUSES">Section B</a></b>, we find, first, autopsied cases and cases with lumbar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_884" id="Page_884">[884]</a></span>
puncture data; then cases with prominent admixture of
organic phenomena; a few cases to illustrate the victims’ own
impressions of their disease; the long toe to top, or “cephalad”
series (crural monoplegias and paraplegias, campto-cormias,
astasia-abasias, brachial monoplegias, brachial paraplegias,
deafmutism, blindness); the series to illustrate the
idea of reflex or physiopathic disorders; the series of delayed
Shell-shock phenomena; the series to show the picking out
by Shell-shock of ante-bellum weak spots and tendencies in
the organism; cases touching the hereditary question; peculiar
and unique cases; examples of Shell-shock equivalents;
and cases of a psychopathic rather than local hystero-traumatic
trend.</p>

<p id="paragraph90"><b>90.</b> At the outset of <a href="#B_SHELL-SHOCK_NATURE_AND_CAUSES">Section B (Shell-shock: Nature and
Causes)</a>, we face the question of the possibly organic nature
of Shell-shock. It is safe to say that the vast majority of
cases of Shell-shock do not die of Shell-shock, and the collection
of material from true Shell-shock cases that are killed
by accident or intercurrent disease has proved a matter of
great difficulty under military conditions. Of course, it is
possible to answer the question <i>à priori</i>, by agreeing that
any case with structural lesion of whatever sort, is by the
same token not a case of Shell-shock.</p>

<p id="paragraph91"><b>91.</b> Apparently the most informatory case yet presented is
that of Mott (<a href="#case197">Case 197</a>). In this case, death came in 24
hours, and the immediate cause of death was doubtless a
small hemorrhage of the spinal bulb. There was a congestion
of veins in the bulb, as well as a congestion of the pia mater
over all other parts of the brain. Nor was the bulbar hemorrhage
unique, for there were a number of superficial punctate
hemorrhages. In short, the brain was not even grossly
normal, such as one might desire in a case of true Shell-shock
as conceived by <i>à priori</i> workers. Yet, according to Mott,
there are microscopic changes of an intimate nature that lie
nearer to the microscopic possibilities in true Shell-shock.
For example, in the bulb itself there was a distinct and photographable
change of nerve cells: <b>the vago-accessorius nucleus
had cells in a state of chromatolysis</b>. The internal alterations
of these cells, with dissolution of chromatic material, may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_885" id="Page_885">[885]</a></span>
possibly indeed have been the direct cause of death or an
indicator of its direct cause. Here again, to accord full
justice to Mott’s contention, we are dealing perhaps more
with a phenomenon of the cause of death than with a Shell-shock
phenomenon. According to Mott, the Shell-shock
symptoms themselves are due to capillary anemia and to
nerve cell changes such as he found in various regions. These
nerve cell lesions were of the nature of chromatolysis and
identical with those of the vago-accessorius nucleus. In this
connection, one thinks of the ideas of Crile concerning exhaustion
and its effect upon certain nerve cells and other
cells, and indeed the whole conception runs back to the early
years of discussion of the meaning of chromatin deposits in
nerve cells, and to the work on fatigue of such cells. It may
well be that Mott’s suggestion is sound, and that changes of
the order of chromatolysis are what subtend some, if not most,
of the phenomena of Shell-shock. On account of the myriad
interconnections of neurones and the remote effects upon
normal neurones of disturbances of a microchemical or microphysical
nature in a few neurones, it would not do to throw
out of court forthwith such a contention as that of Mott by
triumphantly pointing to the miracle cures of certain Shell-shock
phenomena; for it will not necessarily be the chromatolytic
(or otherwise microchemically or physically altered)
cells that will be directly responsible for the symptoms in
question. Cells whose activity is but temporarily in abeyance
(perhaps by phenomena akin to diaschisis) might be
reached from an unusual source in the process of “miracle
cure,” whereupon the newly opened paths of energy might
conceivably remain open. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied
that there are considerable stretches of speculation in the
thread of this hypothesis.</p>

<p id="paragraph92"><b>92.</b> Particularly important is the question, how frequently
such hemorrhages as those found by Mott in <a href="#case197">Case 197</a> occur.
Cases are given in the text which show such hemorrhages.</p>

<p>Rather often quoted in this relation is <a href="#case201">Case 201</a>, a case of
Sencert, in which a shell exploded one metre away from a
soldier and injured him so that he died that night through
the bursting of the pleura of both lungs within a thoracic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_886" id="Page_886">[886]</a></span>
cage which was quite intact. This sort of finding reminds one
of cases in which the inner partitions of houses are burst by
explosion when the outer walls remain intact. In particular,
one thinks of the physical changes within an aneroid barometer,
which have been shown to come about when something
is exploded near by. If such an event may happen as the
bursting of the lungs within an otherwise intact body, so
also is there evidence that a similar event occurs in the nervous
system. Clinical evidence of this is obtained in the
hemorrhage and pleocytosis of spinal fluid obtained early in
the clinical examination of certain cases. In fact, in <a href="#case205">Case
205</a> (one of Souques), there is a pleocytosis of the fluid as
late as a month after shell-shock. When there is no pleocytosis
or hemorrhage, there may be a hypertension of the fluid,&mdash;a
finding sometimes attributed to Dejerine (see, for example,
<a href="#case207">Case 207</a>, of Leriche). It might be inquired whether
the fall sustained by the patient as a result of the shell explosion
could not be responsible for the hemorrhage, and this
may indeed be the fact in certain instances. Babinski has
offered in <a href="#case209">Case 209</a>, an instance in which hematomyelia
(with later partial recovery) was produced in a subject who
was lying prone in the performance of machine-gun duty (the
phenomena in this case were well described by the victim himself,
a veterinary student who was six months a captive in
Germany). Doubtless, it would not be difficult to produce
a complete series of cases with and without trauma to the
tissues investing the nervous system, with definite clinical
or autopsy evidence of organic lesions of the nervous system,
whether by mechanical impact, by the concussion (windage)
of the air, or even by the effects of muscular contractions.</p>

<p id="paragraph93"><b>93.</b> A case of Chavigny’s (<a href="#case198">Case 198</a>), in which there was an
extremely careful autopsy, showed a strongly blood-stained
cerebrospinal fluid; in fact, there was an intradural hemorrhage,
though of minor degree and possibly not the cause of
death; and throughout the brain substance there were slight
hemorrhagic points. But there was no sign whatever of fracture
of the cranial vault or base. Another case of similar
meningeal hemorrhage but sharply localized, was <a href="#case199">Case 199</a>, an
instance of minor explosion in which neither skin nor muscles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_887" id="Page_887">[887]</a></span>
bone or viscera showed any lesion; and the death, which
occurred in seven days, seemed hardly explicable on the basis
of hemorrhage itself. In fact, this case would require the
sort of microscopic examination performed by Mott in <a href="#case197">Case
197</a> for a proof of the cause of death, which was thought by
the reporters themselves (Roussy and Boisseau) to be within
the field of histology.</p>

<p id="paragraph94"><b>94.</b> <a href="#case200">Case 200</a> seems to bring proof that there may be areas
of gross softening within the spinal cord produced by the
concussion of the cord from shell-burst, although there had
been no fracture of the spine itself and no penetration of
splinters of shell or of bone into the spinal canal or the substance
of the cord itself. The argument here is that the
tissues that lie between the agent of violence and the interior
of the spinal cord are affected <i>en bloc</i> by the impact, the resultant
gross or molar lesions being several millimetres or
centimetres from the point reached by the impinging body or
force. How complicated such a situation might be, we may
recall from a case previously studied, namely, <a href="#case103">Case 103</a>
(Lhermitte), wherein a missile struck the left side of the skull
and produced lesions beneath its point of impact, but at the
same time apparently caused a <i>contre-coup</i> effect upon the
opposite hemisphere. That particular case did not come to
autopsy, but Lhermitte’s explanation of its queer association
of aphasia with ipsilateral hemiplegia seems sound enough.
In fine, what with the mechanical trauma to which many
victims of shell explosion are subject, what with the findings
in sundry autopsies, and what with the determination of
hemorrhage in the spinal fluid early after the shock, it might
be conceived that the majority of cases of Shell-shock are
actually cases of mechanical injury to the brain or spinal
cord in which hemorrhage or laceration and overriding of
neuronic tissues would be found. Nor would such a hypothesis
be <i>prima facie</i> absurd with the evidence afforded by
certain cases of Shell-shock having an admixture of reflex
phenomena and other symptoms proved by the older neurologists
to be beyond peradventure organic. (Compare, for
example, such a case as that of <a href="#case210">Case 210</a>, with herpes zoster
and segmentary symptoms.) It should be remembered, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_888" id="Page_888">[888]</a></span>
that Mott in the case cited above (<a href="#case197">Case 197</a>) sharply
distinguishes between the hemorrhages (especially the bulbar
hemorrhage which caused death) and the nerve cell chromatolysis
which he regarded as possibly at the basis of
Shell-shock symptoms. It is decidedly doubtful whether
the hypothesis of microscopic or larger hemorrhages, or of
local areas of destruction of neurones will suffice for the
explanation of true Shell-shock. This is not to say that in
the diagnosis of true Shell-shock (that is, roughly speaking,
the psychoneurosis), we shall not need to concede and consider
in every case the possibility of <b>traumatic focal brain
disease</b>. This will always need <b>to be faithfully excluded</b> in
all cases unless the initial set-up of symptoms is so suggestive
of immediately curable psychoneurosis that without further
ado miracle-therapy is undertaken and executed. But in
virtually all the slower cases, an exclusion of organic brain
and cord disease is undertaken. Admixtures of organic and
focal phenomena are quite in the order of everyday occurrence.</p>

<p id="paragraph95"><b>95.</b> Especially good instances of this co-existence of functional
and organic symptoms are found in ear cases; and
it may be suspected that when, after the war, all these data
can be suitably gathered and compared, it will be from the
field of otology that some of the most fruitful hypotheses will
be developed. In the cases of Shell-shock deafness, mechanical
peripheral factors are admixed with central factors in
phenomena admitting in some ways more exact diagnosis
than in other fields. We may await the correlation of these
data by some worker, equally skilled in otology and neurology,
with the profoundest interest. Analogous results may be
hoped from a correlation of neurological and ophthalmological
conceptions.</p>

<p id="paragraph96"><b>96.</b> Suffice it to say that the differentiation of organic and
functional phenomena has long been possible on the basis of
what we know concerning various reflexes (<i>e.g.</i>, the Babinski
reflex and its congeners); and the net result of this work
is that the majority of Shell-shock cases,&mdash;that is, cases in
which the physical factor shell-shock has entered,&mdash;are probably
not cases in which a coarse organic disease could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_889" id="Page_889">[889]</a></span>
proved to exist, or assumed with any color of likelihood to
exist. Even limiting ourselves to cases in which the physical
factor shell-shock or some sort of impact with or without
an external wound occurred, we shall find cases enough of a
truly functional nature, as indicated by their reflexes, to
render it quite impossible to assert that they are in the classical
sense “organic” cases. Putting these cases with the
physical shell-shock factors together with the other large
series of cases in which precisely similar symptoms occur
without the presence of the physical shell-shock factor, we
shall find ourselves convinced that classical Shell-shock phenomena
are by and large what is called functional. We shall
arrive at the hypothesis that they are cases of hysteria or
other form of psychoneurosis, entitled to the diagnosis of
traumatic hysteria (or hysterotraumatism, in the sense of
Charcot), or not, according to whether the physical factor
shell-shock was in evidence. What now underlies the
concept functional, as we use it in Charcot’s sense of
hysterotraumatism, or in the more modern phrase traumatic
hysteria? Do we perhaps mean some microchemical
or microphysical change of a reversible nature, similar to
that described by Mott, <i>e.g.</i>, in <a href="#case197">Case 197</a>? It is not possible
to answer this question at this time.</p>

<p id="paragraph97"><b>97.</b> But if we give up the hypothesis of organic disease of
the nervous system (that is, the hypothesis of coarse lesions,
small or large, conceived to be the direct effect of mechanical
impact), can we incriminate any other factor? Chemical
factors from the gas of bursting shells may be thought of;
yet in abundant cases there is no evidence that these have been
in play. They and a variety of other special causes may be
found working in a few instances but have nothing to do with
the moot question.</p>

<p id="paragraph98"><b>98.</b> Upon giving up the organic hypothesis, the modern
functionalist is very apt to run directly into the embrace of
hysteria. If a thing is not physical, it must be psychical in
its genesis, so runs the argument. What, after all, is a neurosis?
We mean ordinarily by neurosis, something functional
rather than structural. We often mean something psychical
rather than peripheral. Accordingly, as we have seen, many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_890" id="Page_890">[890]</a></span>
writers rush to the hypothesis that Shell-shock effects, except
in a few unusual instances of organic disease, are functional;
and not only are they functional but psychic, and maintained
by some of the so-called “mechanisms” which abound
in modern speculative writing.</p>

<p id="paragraph99"><b>99.</b> <a href="#case253">Case 253</a>, a case of Tinel, may serve to illustrate this
point. Tinel’s patient was not subject to shell-shock at all,
but was wounded in the arm. Three weeks later, he was able
to flex his forearm only by means of the supinator longus.
It was found that the biceps was soft and flaccid, though the
electrical reactions of the biceps were normal. Now, since
flexion of the forearm is normally produced by a synergic contraction
of the biceps and supinator longus, the situation in
Tinel’s case was striking in that the functions of the biceps
and supinator longus had been separated out by a process
which could not be hysterica. The hypothesis is that in
hysteria it has always been found impossible to split the
synergic action of these two muscles. What has happened?
In Tinel’s picturesque phrase, the biceps muscle has been
<b>stupefied</b> by a process which involved no destruction of a
nerve trunk or any important nerve elements. This process
of stupefaction passed away with a few weeks’ massage and
rhythmic faradism. But what is this process of stupefaction,
as Tinel calls it? No definite answer can be given. But is
not the process analogous to what may happen in a variety of
cases of shell explosion in which, for one reason or another,
sundry neurones are, as it were, stupefied, stunned, anesthetized,
or thrown out of gear by some internal physico-chemical
readjustment of unknown nature? Perhaps that
readjustment, though in Tinel’s case it probably took place
within the tissues of the arm itself, is analogous to the chromatolytic
process in nerve-cell bodies suspected by Mott to
be at the bottom of certain Shell-shock symptoms as in <a href="#case197">Case
197</a>.</p>

<p id="paragraph100"><b>100.</b> Are there, then, phenomena of peripheral nerve shock
analogous to the phenomena of spinal cord and brain shock
which we find in so many cases? But if so, it is clearly
unnecessary, and indeed injurious for us to conceive that
cases proved not to be organic must necessarily be hysterical.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_891" id="Page_891">[891]</a></span>
Several authors have called a halt upon this undue extension
of the concept of hysteria to include all the non-organic
phenomena. Take, for example, the case of the Victoria
Cross winner (<a href="#case529">Case 529</a>), reported by Eder, in which a contracture
was shown by hypnosis to be a representation of the
patient’s clutch upon his bayonet (he had been at Gallipoli
and was wounded in fourteen places during a bayonet fight
with Turks). It would not be possible&mdash;in fact, it would
seem almost impolite&mdash;to refuse to entertain the hypothesis
of a kind of symbolism in the bayonet-clutch contracture of
Eder’s case; but it would, on the contrary, be far from
exact to consider all cases of contracture to be even probably
or possibly symbolic in the manner of the bayonet-clutch.
There are, many workers feel, many functional phenomena
that are non-hysterical, and as it were infra-hysterical in the
sense that the “mechanisms” (to use that over-worked term)
are in neurones below the level of complexity required by
hysteria. This theoretical possibility (that the functional
should be divided into the psychical and the infrapsychical)
has been given a new status by the work of Babinski and his
associates. That work seems to show that the older doctrines
of Charcot concerning the existence of “reflex” disorders,
are perfectly sound.</p>

<p id="paragraph101"><b>101.</b> Babinski has been able to bring into the light of
observation the morbid operation of certain of these reflex
arcs. Even in cases where in the waking life the central
nervous system is able to overpower the reflex arcs in question
and permit the limb or limbs to work reasonably well and
smoothly, the process of chloroform anesthesia will quickly
bring out an odd and unsuspected interior situation. The
chloroform suspends the operation of numerous neurones,
including those that have to do with the downflow of cerebral
inhibitions, those silent streams of impulse that serve to
keep the knee-jerks, for example, in leash. Now at a time
when all the other muscles of the body are relaxed, the withdrawal
of the cerebral inhibitions by chloroform anesthesia
may cause a phenomenon to appear in certain reflex arcs that
argues an excess of activity; thus in the leg, for example, an
ankle-clonus, or a patella-clonus, or a degree of contracture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_892" id="Page_892">[892]</a></span>
may be brought about early in chloroform anesthesia, though
there had been little or no suspicion of such a tendency in the
waking life. The cerebral inhibitions in the waking life
have been enough to dampen the ardor of the reflex arc in
question. It must be remarked that these cases of reflex, or,
as Babinski termed them, <i>physiopathic disorders</i>, as a rule
occur in cases locally wounded. It is the locally wounded
limb that develops functional excess of contained reflex arcs.
Does this occur by a process of neuritis, or by some other
unknown process? Whatever the answer to this question,
Babinski and his associates appear to have shown the existence
of a group of physiopathic or reflex disorders; disorders
below the level of the psyche and below the theatre of operations
of hysteria.</p>

<p id="paragraph102"><b>102.</b> Practically speaking, also, it is important not to
consider every functional situation hysterical, since the non-hysterical
functional changes may be extremely obstinate to
treatment. Both physician and patient suffer if the patient
is treated along psychotherapeutic lines for hysterical symptoms,
some of which turn out on investigation to be functional
enough but non-psychic. The peculiar configuration of
symptoms shown in cases with the physical shell-shock or its
equivalent, is perhaps dependent upon what neurones are
locally affected. If there has been good evidence of near-by
explosion or of wound, it will be especially important to
learn just what parts of the nervous system and just what
synergic neurones and other structures were affected.
Whether the process within these neurones be one analogous
to the dissolution of chromatin, or whether the process is
more like one of narcosis, or narcosis and stupefaction, or
whether the process is more like that of a stun, or like the
plight of the nerves in a foot for a long time “asleep,” it may
be impossible to say; but it is entirely unnecessary to soar
directly to the higher mental process, unnecessary in short,
to assume a hysterical dissociation when the dissociation may
be far lower down in the nervous system.</p>

<p id="paragraph103"><b>103.</b> We have pictured the practical situation in which the
neuroses of the war find themselves&mdash;a situation bristling
with diagnostic difficulties. The great proposition deducible
therefrom is,</p>

<p><b>The diagnostic problem in Shell-shock is the diagnostic
problem of neuropsychiatry at large.</b></p>

<p>The neuroses of war have this in common with the neuroses
of peace&mdash;that they need to be distinguished from all other
nervous and mental diseases. One cannot be a specialist in
Shell-shock unless one is a neuropsychiatric specialist; even
the neuropsychiatrist has much to learn from the internist,
the orthopedist, the neurosurgeon, as well as from the psychologist.</p>

<p><b>But however wide the diagnostic field for Shell-shock, the
therapeutic field is wider still.</b> For the neuropsychiatric reconstructionist
has to face the peculiarities of the military
status of his ward, the difficulties of demobilization into
civilian life (a canal system with very precise technic for the
opening and closing of locks), the choice and timing of the
proper measures of bedside occupation, of occupation therapy
in a broader sense, of prevocational and vocational training&mdash;the
whole complicated by the character changes that may
have set in to bowl over all one’s preconceptions. The nub
of the matter, after the era of the <i>manière forte</i>, the brusque
psychotherapy, the rough jarring of the man back into approximate
normality is, perhaps, this potentiality of subtle
character changes defying possibly anybody’s analysis, but
stimulating us all to our best endeavor, whether we are physicians,
psychologists, occupation-workers, social workers, or
nurses. Now that all sorts of reconstruction programs are
in the air, each claiming its share, or more than its share, of
attention, let us not forget that no one can stake out in any
small plot the measures of refitting, readjustment, readaptation,
rehabilitation&mdash;all these terms with slightly differing
denotation have been used&mdash;especially when we take into
account that not only must the patient be refitted to his entourage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_894" id="Page_894">[894]</a></span>
but also not seldom the entourage to its returned
Shell-shocker.</p>

<p id="paragraph104"><b>104.</b> It is proper to place these general considerations first
because <b>the slow, patient, prosaic measures of reëducation
are apt to be forgotten in our enthusiasm for the lightning-like
cures of the hypnotic, the psychoelectric, the pseudo-operative,
and other psychotherapeutic forms</b>. Psychotherapy
in all its forms has come into its own in Shell-shock.
Miracles or their equivalents are daily wrought by men who
are not prophets. Lourdes and Christian Science have their
unassuming rivals. Let us remember, however, that even
Lourdes and Christian Science never solved 100% of the
problems placed before them, even though the votaries have
the best will in the world to be cured. If the will itself is
disordered, what can be done save investigate? And the
<i>mauvaise volonté</i> is by no means absent from some of our
prospective patients; witness one man, a Frenchman, who
so resented being cured by <i>torpillage</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, by the electric
brush, that he carried his case against Clovis Vincent, who
cured him of his hysteria, clear to the Academy! And, even
after we have cured our cases by these modern miracles, let
us not be too proud of ourselves! One soldier sent back to
Australia, hysterically mute for months, got his voice back
after killing a snake&mdash;a peculiar instance of occupation-therapy,
not enumerated in courses on reconstruction. And
remember the man who jumped the wall and got drunk,
breaking back into the hospital to show his doctor how his
refractory voice had at last come back. Thus there are cures
and cures (even a newspaper cure of mutism by a moving
picture vision of the antics of Charlie Chaplin), and spontaneous
non-medical cures as well as medical ones, and slow
cures due to <i>vis medicatrix</i>, as well as to shrewd reëducation
measures.</p>

<p id="paragraph105"><b>105.</b> I shall not attempt to cover systematically the topic
of Shell-shock therapy in this epicrisis. The reader must go
through the treated cases, especially in <a href="#D_TREATMENT_AND_RESULTS_OF">Section D</a> but <i>passim</i>
elsewhere, if he is to obtain a proper conception of all the
methods so far employed&mdash;and at the end he cannot know
the ultimate outcome of the cases. Patrons of the miracle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_895" id="Page_895">[895]</a></span>
cures and the <i>manière forte</i> are having their day: on the whole,
the law of <b>sudden onset, sudden ending</b> has much to say for
itself in the hysterical (pithiatic) group. Forebodings of
relapse in these <b>torpedoed</b> cases may indeed have some foundation:
but figures are yet lacking, and relapses may be as
expectantly predicted in the <b>slow-onset, slow-cure</b> group.
<b>The decision must be post-bellum.</b> Nor must the fact that
a few absolutely normal subjects have succumbed <i>de novo</i>
to Shell-shock blind us to the fact that, statistically speaking,
most cases are <i>ab ovo</i> psychopaths in whom relapses, recurrences,
or new instances of neurosis may be confidently expected.
For these <i>ab ovo</i> psychopaths, what can suffice but
(<i>a</i>) removal of the disease by the <i>vis medicatrix naturae</i>; or
(<i>b</i>) reëducation, intellectual or (<i>c</i>) moral (as the case may be);
or else (<i>d</i>) some plan of environmental shielding from new
occasions of disease?</p>

<p id="paragraph106"><b>106.</b> I shall content myself with a brief survey (insisting
that the details be read of at least the leading cases in
each treatment subgroup) of the cases offered in <a href="#D_TREATMENT_AND_RESULTS_OF">Section <b>D</b>
(Shell-shock: Treatment and Results)</a>, consisting of 117 cases
(<a href="#case473">Cases 473-589</a>). The cases are in general arranged with
the <b>spontaneous and quasi-natural cures</b> at the outset,&mdash;a
series of 11 cases (<a href="#case473">Cases 473-483</a>). The remainder of the
section deals with cures under medical conditions, although
many cases naturally show an interplay of non-medical factors
in the cure or persistence of one or more symptoms.</p>

<p>A few cases illustrative of the <b>physical value of hydrotherapy</b>,
<b>mechanical therapy</b>, and <b>drugs</b> are given in a short
series (<a href="#case484">Cases 484-489</a>). A treatment of hysterical contractures
by <b>induced fatigue</b> is dealt with in <a href="#case489">Cases 489-493</a>; and
the occasional value of <b>surgery</b> is shown by <a href="#case494">Case 494</a>.</p>

<p>The simpler methods of <b>persuasion and explanation</b> follow
in a series of 19 cases (<a href="#case495">Cases 495-513</a>).</p>

<p><b>Pseudo-operations</b> and <b>suggestive operative manipulation</b>
of avail in the treatment of certain local hysterical phenomena
are considered in a series of eight cases (<a href="#case514">Cases 514-521</a>). The
comparatively long <b>hypnotic series</b> follows: 27 cases (<a href="#case522">Cases
522-548</a>). The above-mentioned cures by pseudo-operation
and by hypnosis may be classified with those that follow, <i>i.e.</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_896" id="Page_896">[896]</a></span>
mainly rapid cures by <b>psychoelectric</b> methods and by <b>suggestion
on emergence from anesthesia</b> (<a href="#case549">Cases 549-574</a>), as
modern miracles. These cases of modern miracle are followed
by a briefer set of <b>reëducative cases</b> (<a href="#case575">Cases 575-589</a>).</p>

<p>Throughout the treatment section are scattered instances
in which, not a cure, but merely a modification or even a
persistence of symptoms was the outcome. It is useful to
bear in mind, while reading cases in the etiological and diagnostic
sections, these main divisions of treatment into what
might be called (1) spontaneous, (2) rapid (or “miraculous”)
and (3) slow or reëducative.</p>

<p id="paragraph107"><b>107.</b> It is beyond the scope of this book to deal systematically
with the hospital and administrative side of these questions.
Especially the zone question is of practical importance,
that is, the question of arrangements at the front, on evacuation
lines, and in the interior. Roussy and Lhermitte have
particularly discussed these matters.</p>

<p>After thirty months’ experience in the psychiatric centers
of two armies, Damaye suggested an organization of psychiatric
centers in two parts,&mdash;First, a service draining
patients <b>from the firing line</b>, rapidly give them first care and
evacuate them, <b>in charge of special attendants</b>, to: Second, a
psychiatric or neurological <b>center in the communication zone</b>
(<i>étapes</i>) without danger of bombardment and at a distance
from the guns. The more serious cases will then be evacuated,
thirdly, into the interior from these centers along communication
lines. But most will have gotten well at the front.</p>

<p id="paragraph108"><b>108.</b> By orthopedists and mechanotherapeutists too much
stress may indeed be laid on non-psychiatric measures, as
Duprat hints. Yet perhaps neuropsychiatrists may need
as much coaching in the opposite direction. One must
remember the non-psychopathic fraction of these Shell-shock
disorders and their need of diathermy (Babinski). Duprat
says that the centers for physiotherapy cannot effectively do
the work of all Shell-shock therapy, as the physiotherapists
have their aims fixed on nerves and muscles rather than the
mind. Each case requiring psychotherapy ought to be
studied in an <b>experimental psychological laboratory</b> from a
number of points of view such as mechano-motor capacity,
the sensibility, emotional and intellectual sides, memory,
impulses and the like. Testing apparatus should be available
together with dynamometers, sphygmometers, chronoscopes,
ergographs, pneumographs, cardiographs and recording apparatus.</p>

<p>Specialists for consultation should be available, including
ophthalmologists, otologists, laryngologists and electrical
specialists. The tests over, the patient should be examined
as it were, in a free state and his habits and character noted.
Hypnosis may be tried but it should not be prolonged.
Psychic contagion is to be avoided especially in the case of
subjects with epileptoid crises.</p>

<p>It would be well to establish for the cases regarded as susceptible
to psychotherapy, <b>reëducation centers</b> like those for
the re-adaptation of the tuberculous. The improved tuberculous
are sent to health centers under the Ministry of the
Interior for three months at the maximum and emerge much
better able to support the exigencies of life. According to
Duprat, there ought to be <b>psychotherapy centers</b> which should
not in any sense recall asylums for the insane. Set in the
country but not far from the city, managed by the psychological
physicians and “<i>médecins psychologues, plus éducateurs
que médecins</i>.” The personnel should consist of students
going into psychiatry and of teachers whose pedagogical
practice ought to enable them to second the efforts of the
psychiatrists. In this way we might avoid the perpetuation
of some of the psychopathies of war.</p>

<p id="paragraph109"><b>109.</b> Possibly “putting forward the best foot” may
yield a wrong impression of the proportion of what I have
termed “miracle cures.” Other devices of a slower nature
are mentioned throughout the book. Perhaps much depends
on the temperament of the psychotherapeutist, as <i>e.g.</i>,
Laignel-Lavastine has remarked about the method of psychotherapy
by means of conversation: that <b>one might easily remain
in a honeymoon state in military psychotherapy</b>. When
hundreds and thousands of functional nervous cases pass
through one’s hands it is necessary to remember that behind
the conversation there stands the imposing finger of material
force.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_900" id="Page_900">[900]</a></span></p>

<p>Compare the work of Clovis Vincent, Yealland, Kaufmann.</p>

<p id="paragraph110"><b>110.</b> On the other hand, Rows points out that shock is a
term that does not explain at all adequately the great variety
of mental illnesses occurring in the soldiers at the front. The
term is popularly used for cases which recover quickly, but
in the majority of cases there is a residuum after the shock has
disappeared. Accordingly Rows’ work has dealt chiefly with
underlying causes, conditions, and factors. Here we may
consider</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(<i>a</i>) The <b>war strain</b> before breakdown;</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <b>Special causes</b> of shock, such as death of comrades
near by, near-by shell explosions and blowing up
of trenches;</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <b>Fatigue and exhaustion</b> with lowered capacity of
resistance.</p>

<p>The men themselves find that they have</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) undergone a <b>change of character</b>, having become
irascible, unable to sustain interest and attention;
solitary and morose, and less capable of self-control.
Anxiety, worry and a state of morbid expectancy
set in. Everyday trifles are exaggerated.</p>

<p>But below these cases are still deeper ones, such
as</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) revival of <b>horrible memories and terrifying dreams</b>
of war scenes, together with memories of incidents
of past life.</p>

<p>(Rows attributes to Dejerine the idea that the
cause of all cases of hysteria and neurasthenia
must be sought in antecedent emotion.)</p>

</div>

<p>Emotion compels attention, and to such a degree in some
cases that the memories and attendant fears and anxieties
cannot be expelled. Hallucinations and delusions may then
develop. The patient is largely incapable of reasoning about
his status; he lacks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_901" id="Page_901">[901]</a></span> “insight into the nature and mode of
origin of his mental illness. This insight can be provided by
explaining to him in plain language the mechanism of simple
mental processes, by enabling him to understand that every
incident is accompanied by its own special emotional state,
and that this emotional state can be re-awakened by the revival
of the incident in memory.” The patient and the
physician now “begin to realize that they have some ground
in common.… The mystery of the illness will be swept
away and the physician will be able to … show him how
he can educate himself to regain that which was lost.”
“The patient can be induced to face the trouble.” “The
excessive emotional tone will thus be stripped away and the
patient will thus become able to appreciate the real value of
the incident.” “The reëducation must vary with each
case in order to overcome the difficulties connected with the
specific cause which has been discovered.”</p>

<p>Rows’ work has been done at the Red Cross Hospital at
Maghull, and several of the Maghull cases have been reported
in Elliot Smith and T. H. Pear’s book on Shell-shock. A
somewhat similar point of view has been maintained by
Wm. Brown, who has suggested the neat term <i>autognosis</i> for
psychoanalysis. W. A. Turner speaks of the Maghull point
of view as one of modified psychoanalysis.</p>

<p id="paragraph111"><b>111.</b> Or again a species of combination of the <i>manière forte</i>
and the <i>manière douce</i> (operations, shall we say with William
James, of the “tough-minded” and the “tender-minded”
respectively?) may be used as in the formula</p>

<p class="center">SYMPATHY + FIRMNESS (<span class="smcap">Mott</span>).</p>

<p id="paragraph112"><b>112.</b> More special devices, suggesting faintly the methods
of animal training, may be used, as described in the following
account of a new <b>isolation and psychotherapeutic service</b>
established in May, 1915, at the <b>Salpêtrière</b> for soldiers with
functional nervous diseases. The basic idea has long been
held by Dejerine,&mdash;the avoidance of heterosuggestion by
other patients, imitation, ill effects of visits from members of
the family. The functional additions that come from near-by
organic patients are among the disadvantages of the ordinary
treatment. The isolation service of the neurological center is
composed of 34 beds, arranged in two halls, with three extra
rooms. Each bed is isolated. The régime in one of the rooms
is more rigorous than in the other, and <b>it is an advance for a
patient to be moved from the first to the second room</b>. The
patient on wakening has no right to leave his box or communicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_902" id="Page_902">[902]</a></span>
with his neighbors. He leaves only to be treated
by hydrotherapy or electrotherapy. He takes his meals in
isolation, receives no calls, and has no leave to go out. The
physician sees the patient twice a day and carries on psychotherapy
and motor reëducation, as well as special treatments.</p>

<p>Women nurses care for the patients. A system of control
and of <b>progressive rewards</b> has been installed, being a sort of
metric evaluation of the process of cure. As the cure proceeds
the patient’s lot is progressively mitigated, or if he gets
worse the regime is clamped down. Suppose a man a victim
of paralysis of leg&mdash;the height to which he can lift his
leg is measured in centimeters daily as well as the time during
which he can hold the leg in air; or, the progress of an ankle,
or of the forearm or the arm in a case of arm contracture,
is measured. The grade obtained by our <b>scholar in psychotherapy</b>
is inscribed upon a slate. Finally, walks, concerts,
visits and eventually permission to go out into the town are
granted.</p>

<p id="paragraph113"><b>113.</b> <b>Can Shell-shock neuroses be prevented</b>, other than
by stopping or modifying the war or by weeding out Shell-shock
candidates as they volunteer or are drafted? Morton
Prince offers points of some suggestive value. The very
various proportions of neurosis observed in different units
and arms of the service suggest that various degrees of preparedness
may have played a part. Bernheim says <b>suggestion</b>
is an <b>idea accepted</b>. Aside from a possible increase
of simulation, much might depend on what idea administered
really got accepted! Morton Prince’s plan is that the prevention
must be based upon the education of the mind. This
therapeutic education should be based, however, on a preliminary
systematic study by a board of specialists in the
psychoneuroses of (<i>a</i>) the mental attitude of minds generally
toward shell fire, and (<i>b</i>) clinical varieties of this “shock”
neurosis as it occurs in trench warfare, (<i>c</i>) its frequency and
disabling incidence, and (<i>d</i>) the state of mind previous to the
trauma of those suffering from it.</p>

<p>On the basis of the findings of such a study, first, the regimental
surgeon through lectures and clinical demonstrations
would be instructed systematically in the symptoms and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_903" id="Page_903">[903]</a></span>
pathology of the disease and the methods of psychotherapy
for its prevention.</p>

<p>Second, soldiers, including officers, could then, in units of
say 100, in turn be instructed in the nature of the disease
through lectures by regimental surgeons. Shell-shock, they
should be told, is a form of hysteria caused by mental factors.
The work of the instruction should be done in France in the
atmosphere of the war, wherein would be formed an attitude
of healthy mental preparedness instead of an attitude of fear
and mystery. Has mental hygiene this great scope? <b>Is
morale merely education?</b></p>

<p id="paragraph114"><b>114.</b> <b>What after all, is Morale?</b> We hope to learn a little
about it from this war for use hereafter, when we can say
with the Florentine</p>

<h2><a name="BIBLIOGRAPHY" id="BIBLIOGRAPHY"></a>BIBLIOGRAPHY</h2>

<p>These references were collected in the main by Sergeant Norman Fenton
both before and after his entering the army, in connection with preparations
for the work of one of the Neuropsychiatric Training Schools (that at Boston),
established by the Division of Neurology and Psychiatry of the Surgeon-General’s
Office, U. S. Army. The work, through the year 1917, at least, is not a
mere <i>vernis de bibliographe</i>, but is based on a first-hand search through journals
available in the Boston Medical Library and the New York Academy of Medicine
(to whose officers thanks are due for very special privileges accorded).
After Sergeant Fenton’s departure for service in the war neurosis hospital, 117,
American E. F., France, the work was finished by the writer in considerable
haste by skimming the current indexes and gathering the more prominent titles
for 1918 (some for 1919). The titles, be it noted, go beyond the scope of the
case-material in the body of the book and cover also a variety of reconstructional,
reëducational, clinical-neurological, neurosurgical, and other topics bearing indirectly
on neuropsychiatry. These auxiliary subjects are by no means completely
covered, but it was thought the titles might help other inquirers. Under
the war conditions numerous errors have no doubt crept into the references,
which errors we hope will not, by reason of the short space of time covered by
the bibliography, prove particularly misleading. The auxiliary topics can be
referred to in the Index under page-numbers after the word “Bib.”</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

<h2>START: FULL LICENSE<br />

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
